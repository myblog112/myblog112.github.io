Hopefully, this is 'top-level enough' (above hackmd.io, cryptpad, discord, etc.) ... so I'll be able to 'trackback' [<script name="'trackback'">makeQuizElem2('J3RyYWNrYmFjayc=','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] to it all the time ...
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ This is definitely a [<script name="problem">makeQuizElem2('cHJvYmxlbQ==','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>], that is 'shameful' to admit existence of it ... but again, 'fingers in elecric socket' reflex polarisation ...
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ Again, the problem being, that unless I got some ~ 100-200$ usd in crypto -- this document merely becomes a mere 'another document in filesystem' and I have this 'lost in filesystem' syndrome ...
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ You can blame synchronious knockos on this, but it also sometimes feels like this is even above knockos ... e.g. think municipality (city municipality) and/or government level problem ... like. if you 'remove' knockos, somebody else will 99% come in their place

(and also 'the less human factor' -- the more safer the money) ... and so ... before airdrops -- do I have at least 100$ in bitcoin so that this document keeps being remembered?

[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Immigration precisely to ramat aviv was a matter of 'luck' (?)
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ Удержать свою связь с 'рамат авивским' ['immigration precisely to ramat aviv was a matter of luck' - 'Я'] пока находишься в этом микрорайоне (там тоже такое есть но гораздо меньше ощутимо потому что поток русских и иностранных туристов и смешиваешься с ними и не 'singled out' 'waaaaay too obviously' (они ненавидят белых ашкеназов и даже на мусорных ящиках это пишут!! Рядом с бензоколонкой на ул. гиссин ... или х/з какая другая причина ... гомогенная среда которая ненавидит 'чужаков' они все с друг другом на балкончиках сидят и это часть их 'тайтли-книт коммьюнити'/'tightly-knit community' (?)).

[>] Relation of 'crypto bonding leverage' to 'ifs' and 'dangeli' ... ==> is that if you ever talk about ifs anywhere then you're a 'guru' and then you'll have to overpay SteveP 10,000$ ... and in case of 'IFS' will probably not 'overpay to an ifs therapist' but rather ban from an 'ifs therapist' because he will consider you 'too diffucult' a patient and 'will part with you' 'gently' (everything is for sale) ... 
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ And to bond 'talking/not talking' about ifs with thousands of $$$$ ...

[>] The relation between katrain and crypto? ==> Crypto is needed to shut up and not talk on ifs forums because of parallel between 'Pay SteveP 10000$' phenomenon and 'IFS Therapists Landscape Ban' (which would parallely happen if you 'tell everybody how great IFS is' just like as it would with if you told everybody (['sad'] wink,wink ;) !!) how great 'Stephane' is which would lead you to 'The Guru' aka SteveP and it would not be 'cheap' ...)
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ And with crypto the whole 'airdrop farming' shebang is extremely 'noisy' and 'non-linear' and has 'resting day' 'inner conflict' (is it money or not?) aka though it is helpful in extreme states of psyche -- it 'wants' to be 'minimised' and yet it's 'very difficult' to be minimised (probably to 'bitcoin' and 'rvn mining card') and no 'internet' involvement whatsoever ... ==> And chess/go/baduk is also there as a 'tool' to 'shut up' about the same 'stephane' and 'stevep' and 'ifs' ... as in 'don't give out chess pieces' or give a 'minimal possible' chess pieces to be able to survive the later onset of SteveP overwhelm.

[>] What's the relation of 'mom'/'civ' and crypto? ==> Basically the same as the relation between katrain and crypto (see above), but, sometimes, when you feel when you are going to fly to 'Melahim Be-Rotschild' -- playing 'Mom'/'Civ'/'Ufo-Ea' can help you with confidence that you can still study chess/go to a decent level, without needing external help. 

[>] What's the relation between 'tetris attack' and 'crypto'? ==> Basically as with katrain and crypto - there are 2 problems: (1) Crypto is used to 'bond' against talking about IFS which is disasterous to the extent of 'banned by all ifs therapists' yet the 'sleep doctor didn't yet reach his final verdict' (see more detailed explanation in some other doc (this one is a public doc)). (2) Crypto in itself has problems, such as: (2.1.) A conflict with nosurf (aka fills my head with unneccessant twitter noise all the time when I want is a quiet trauma processing with a fiction book). (2.2.) 'Resting day' 'inner conflict' ... (3) (tbd1,,)
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ And when you get banned from all ifs therapists -- obviously the first thing the [inner] critics will say 'what. a. fucking. idiot. have. you. been.' ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ Definition from wikipedia: 'Idiot' was formerly a technical term in legal and psychiatric contexts for some kinds of profound intellectual disability where the mental age is two years or less, and the person cannot guard themself against common physical dangers.
[>>> 1.1.1.1.] ^^ And yet idiots rarely solve puzzles there seems to be an 'inverse' correlation between an 'idiot' aka. 2 year old child who can barely walk ... and someone who is good at solving non-trivial puzzles quickly. ...
[>>> 1.1.1.1.1.] ^^ And somehow, since 'getting banned' from 'ifs therapists landscape' is 'being such an idiot' then maybe playing tetris attack could, sort of, somehow, 'negate' that before that happened (due again to 'inverse correlation' between an idiot and someone who is good at 'solving some non-trivial puzzles for speed') ... by 'spinning' some sort of 'rusty' 'cog' wheel in the head ... that will 'fire' when I'm about to say something 'wrong' to an ifs therapist that I would normally not notice if I woudn't have trained myself to 'solve non-trivial puzzles quickly' at all ... 

[>] Just like there's 'maintaining the same level' of elo with katrain ... there's also maintaing the same level of some sort of 'elo-like rating' with 'tetris attack' ... (e.g. can you solve/spot 10 matches a minute or is it now only being able to spot 1 match only per 10 minutes)? -- so it is kind of a rate-y too ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Also with 'mom'/'civ' there exists elo-like rating (of some sort) (which is not official but you can get a sense when you've 'deteriorated' too much on that 'meta' scale) ...

[>] Definitely reading blockchain [<script name='technologies'>makeQuizElem2('dGVjaG5vbG9naWVz','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] books _all week_ (not just in 'resting day') could help you not drown further into 'ProblemWebSurfing' airdrop farming madness ...

[>] Maybe install & maintain Brown Dust and Langrisser (gather daily diamonds ...) so you'd have something to do at weekend ..
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ After all he even blackmails you with offline games ...

[>] If I'm that strong that people 'sneeze' due to my thoughts, or that smart that I deserve some sort of a nobel prize (or multiple/several nobel prizes), then how come I've not yet got 150 million in bitcoin? (I said that when I got ~ 150 million - then I can airdrop)

[>] Is there '[<script name='untameable/uncontrollable'>makeQuizElem2('dW50YW1lYWJsZS91bmNvbnRyb2xsYWJsZQ==','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] running commentary that just won't stop' lurking there? (?)

[>] Crypto minimalism ==> Ideally, farming should be achieved with a few mining cards. And no involvement with 'web3' whatsoever.

[>] In crypto chats you should 'shut up' even if it might mean that you lose 1000$ ... -- because the whole point (or one major point) of 'bonding leverage' is 
because you lack (lacked) 'self-disciplining' to be able to shut up about other topics such as 'IFS and Stephane and SteveP 10000$ and IFS Therapists Ban' ... and 
if you open yourself up to communication with some possibly angry and 'unreasonable' mod with whom you might be needing to negotiate 'unban' now ... then you 'set 
yourself up' for a 'hole in self disciplining' which you were lacking in the first place and came to 'bonding leverage' just exactly because of that one problem (!!) ...
(re-read this very paragraph from the beginning (maybe a few times (not trying to be 'offending' here))) ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ So the rule of thumb is - to never, ever talk -- even if it loses us 1000-2000$ ...

[>] Don't forget about [<script name='Eckhart Tolle/Hanan Sagiv narrative'>makeQuizElem2('RWNraGFydCBUb2xsZS9IYW5hbiBTYWdpdiBuYXJyYXRpdmU=','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] when you conversing with parents ... or you gonna fall and never find, never find ...

[>] 'Paralyzing Fame Residue'/'Compliments Overwhelm'/'Grandiosity overwhelm' ==> [This is not 100% bulletproof but] ==> Play with { 'still haven't got [<script name='150 million $'>makeQuizElem2('MTUwIG1pbGxpb24gJA==','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] bitcoin if I'm that very smart huh how come' } narrative (and also 'I can airdrop only when I have 150 million $ in bitcoin and I'm short of that sum so far) (?)
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ It works 'better' because basically I could have that sum without anyone on the planet earth knowing (compared to fiat money)...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ 'That was heroism what you did today!' ==> 'But that heroism wasn't enough to get me to [<script name='150 million $'>makeQuizElem2('MTUwIG1pbGxpb24gJA==','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] in bitcoin, wasn't it? (?)' (?) 
[>>> 1.1.1.1.] ^^ That is valid as long as I got [<script name='24h internet connection'>makeQuizElem2('MjRoIGludGVybmV0IGNvbm5lY3Rpb24=','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] & some [<script name='privacy'>makeQuizElem2('cHJpdmFjeQ==','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>].

[>] What's the relation of 'knocking neighbors' to 'redpill/mra' videos? ==> 'Government-backed [<script name='feminism nonsense'>makeQuizElem2('ZmVtaW5pc20gbm9uc2Vuc2U=','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] overwhelm' vs. 'dick existence' polarisation ...

[>] { 'Government-backed feminism nonsense overwhelm' vs. 'dick existence' } polarisation needs to be fed 'context' ... both the 'cults' context (because r/datingoverfifty is super-hellish) ... also the mra context (medusa wives existence && you are not alone/isolated/ostracised by govt. backed feminsim nonsense overwhelm && how they cope with it) ... 
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ And maybe also cptsd/ifs/did/academically-backed trauma context ('fantastic beasts and where to find them') (you know about Jay Wacker).
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ This can definitely [<script name='impede'>makeQuizElem2('aW1wZWRl','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] getting outside as you meet eyes with pumped-up Fatma's you just lose all hyper-focus there ever ever ever was ... and most certainly get 'lost' on the way ('how a 'skirt' can make a man 'trip') ...
[>>> 1.1.1.1.] ^^ This just puts them from 'a walking angel'/'i saw an angel' state into some more 'neutral' 'balanced' light (e.g. such as what I got from r/femaledatingstrategy: 'she's going to check the baldness of her future bf's father' etc.) ... and hopefully give you more 'rite of passage' ...
[>>> 1.1.1.1.1.] ^^ There's also some 'dark' sh*t to process like 'I don't fit into the gaussian' and 'Aurelia Brouwers' (if I try to expand on this here --> it really 'dark' sh*t trust me ...) ...

[>] Please be gentle with yourself in a sense that before I found out about no-bad-parts frame, I have been rebelling against my own parts .. after listening to owen cook in a sense that I've learned that I've been 'projecting my ego' onto other people and now I'm not ... I'm above that filthy, despicable low-life level!
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ In a sense that when a 'saving grace' voice appeared -- I've been f*cking rebelling against it instead of asking it protector questions ... so I've done a bunch of stupid things, many of whom might take beyond lifetime (not enough vitality, etc.) to unburden ...

[>] The narrative/motive of 'copycat studying' of 'bjj & chin-na' (copycat I mean via palpating their's books, not youtubs) -- for the sake of 'limits problem' -- never went away nowhere ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ With bjj alone you're still in 'fog' in a sense that 'how do you get him to the ground'? So you need chin-na copycatting too ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ And one important takeaway from this is it although you've lost ~60-70% of do-kwon's money ... it's still important to somehow manage not losing the last 100$ in crypto or else this very document ... I won't be able to navigate to ... and will be [<script name='[lost in filesystem]'>makeQuizElem2('ZmlsZXN5c3RlbQ==','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] forever again.
[>>> 1.1.1.1.1] ^^ So from that I suppose - we must infer our 'testnets' and 'airdrops' participation ... (this 'promised airdrop' 'instability'/'jitteredness' unfortunately still remains ...) as I'm still stuck in petah tikva endless maze.

[>] ^^ So how about 'stay the same elo-like rating' with 'bjj & chin-na' and don't 'deteriorate'?
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Always, always try to [<script name='backtrack'>makeQuizElem2('YmFja3RyYWNr','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] back to 'maintaining the same elo' with katrain/mom/civ/tetris-attack if/when tolerable/possible because amnesia left-and-right ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ So there's a lot of ifs protector clusterf*ckia involved here ... (tbd1,,)
[>>> 1.1.1.1.] ^^ First thing there's [<script name='amnesia'>makeQuizElem2('YW1uZXNpYQ==','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] (dementia? (?)) episodes when I 'jump' straight onto bjj youtube vids (even under theembodimentconference.org) 

[>] ^^ So, if we're talking about 'maintaining existing elo levels' - then are there 'elo levels' of: Foreign & Spoken languages knowledge? Of Guitar & Piano knowledge/skill? Of Drawing? Of Tai-chi? Of Programming? Rpg story/journey games? ==> Moved to separate section ...
``` TODELETE
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ If something goes wrong (it did happen once - with 'ifs elo') -- go back / retract to 'maintaining the same elo level with katrain' - it still works ...
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Drawing - probably not (as there is very little 'competition context') ...
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ We need/want that for 'bjj & chin-na' spindown as seemingly just katrain/mom/civ/tetris-attack just don't seem to 'cut' it on their own alone-wise ...
[@ ^ 3.] ^^ It seems that tai-chi (aka. 'martial arts meditation' (as opposed to yoga, which is a 'postures' meditation)) is a 'part of' maintaining same elo level with 'bjj&chin-na'? E.g. 'do at least some 'farthest resemblance' movement? (?) (?) (?)
[@ ^ 3.1.] ^^ Or maybe I'm wrong? (?) (?) (?)
[@ ^ 3.1.1.] ^^ There's no 'maintaining the same elo level with tai-chi kata' because tai-chi is the actually one from which the whole idea of 'keeping _at least_ the same elo level with katrain' hyper-focus came from ... in a sense that it says ... 'at least don't lose martial arts at all if you have bjj painful fracture ... because martial arts are _so_, _so_ important' and 'probably self-rehearsed 'mostly theoretical only' chin-na is better than no chin-na knowledge altogether, even theoretical' from that 'at least don't lose martial arts entirely' probably came the understanding: 'don't lose katrain entirely' ... ==> so supposedly copy-catting chin-na as per jwing ming's books & dvd's (you have both, also for martial applications of it) supposed to 'keep' that 'elo' 'hyper-focus' ==> So I suppose what it should be is: 'copy-catting chin-na and it's martial applications as perfectly as possible' and the best you can make of it ==> Try 'trembling' for it ... who knows ... ==> tbd1,,
[@ ^ 4.] ^^ Is there 'maintaining the same ELO' with ifs? ==> Seems like not so it means that ifs is a 'bottomless pit' yet in some certain situational overwhelm situations it is very useful... and there are a lot of overwhelming situational situations in certain specific GPS locations ... ==> tbd1,,
[@ ^ 4.1.] ^^ Also: ifs is not a bottomless pit in a sense that if a specific individual is in some cult (or jumping between cults) ... then ifs provides an 'academically-refined' cult which is a 'less' 'bottomless pit' than some other 'cults' that exist out there ... due to 'academia-peer-review' property of it ...,, but still tbd1
[@ ^ 4.1.1.] ^^ So in a sense ifs is not a 'bottomless pit' but rather is a 'lesser' 'bottomless pit' which is good for segments of population who reside in a 'bottomless pit' (e.g. cults followers who do not realise and/or blackout within them, the harmful effects of their cults)...
[@ ^ 6.] ^^ Is there 'elo level' regarding 'digital minimalism' and 'extreme privacy' (a.k.a. michael bezzel? (?)) ==> Apparently can't touch that because moving to ramat aviv is on a 'higher note' than 'worrying about extreme privacy' because if I'm not 'careful' then the whole shebang of being near 'internet' & 'privacy' could be 'taken away' from me ... so it's secondary unfortunately (and things will inevitably 'spill' the painful ones which shouldn't ...)
[@ ^ 6.1.]
[@ ^ 7.] ^^ Just curious - is there 'elo level' with bridge? ==> Well yep if you sit 3h bridge marathon with Oren Lidor and/or Doron Yadlin -- you will either score less or score more or equal -- and that determines your elo level compared to them ... 
[@ ^ 7.1.] ^^ This elo level is rather 'sparse' compared to chess e.g. statistical-rather but in overall sense if you run 10-days marathon against one of them ... then their { (1) Memorisation of bidding language. (2) Knowledge to recognise of signals when playing hand. (3) A little bit of algorighmic thinking of how to play and what not to play depending on what partners played (but this algorithmic thinking is much less 'deep' than chess) (4) ? } ==> will to a large extent determine whether they win or a lose in points in that 10 days marathon. But then again, this is not a 'measure' of anything ... e.g. their algorithmic thinking might be more 'mediocre' than a chess player ... their 'language of bidding' knowledge -- might be due to them having inherited that from their rich parents from childhood ... just like french was a language of 'high circles' in some non-french societies ... but again the purpose of this is mostly about not the 'elo' but rather having some sort of alternate venue of connecting with people / making connections with people ... but then again ... this is not the sole way of making connections ... and it's possible that existence of interconnected internet has made this 'bridge' lucrativity even more obsolete ... as one could simply invest in making an arbitrage bot and blow all the bridge people out of the water ... I mean in a sense that 'bridge' was some sort of 'gamble-pointing of a finger' when you were out of options ... and so you saw e.g. some ad in tel-aviv university sports club and thought: ha! this must be it! ... but it is very possible that for example working with parts and interrogating them with protector questions ... in retrospect ... wouldn't bring you to any 'bridge' seeking altogether. E.g. in a sense of: nothing's broke -- don't apply any sort of 'band-aid' on top of it ... it's like more like carrying some notion of 'if it's all so seemingly 'too calm'' then 'add even more overwhelm on top of it' -- 'and then it all will become clear!' sort of mindset .. which might in retrospect not overwhelm -- the already overwhelmed & mega-traumatised system.
[@ ^ 7.1.1.] ^^ When nobody talks ... there's not to 'bring yourself to people' to cause additional overwhelm on the system, that might in fact, be traumatised and needed more of that ramat aviv immersion ...

[@ ^ 8.1.] ^^ Blockchain & Crypto Technology books are probably '>' (bigger) in that domain-or-realm, than 'airdrop farming' ... (considering that plain 'indie-crypto lifetime narrative' is 'overwhelm' ...) 
[@ ^ 8.1.1.] ^^ In a sense that 'dry studying' of that technology somehow helps more than just plain farming/sybilling (although counter-intuitive (wtf does studying even help?!?!? (?)))) ...
[@ ^ 8.2.] ^^ Reading a substantial chunk of crypto-technology-or-blockchain-technology [<script name='book'>makeQuizElem2('Ym9vaw==','&lt;pomflh&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] before doing any faucets and/or airdrops? (?) (in a sense of 'which is higher elo level?' - wise)) -- you have staking already ... so ... 
[@ ^ 8.2.1.] ^^ What I'm trying to get to - is to do only minimalist super-obvious airdrop farming ... and like 2-3 precalculated steps (didn't need to jerky-signup for neither ampleforth, nor optimism, nor stargaze, nor evmos, nor aptos, nor paraswap, nor cowswap, etc.) ... jerky-signups definitely f*cks me up. And a 'book' before faucets could get me into an appropriate mood before jumping onto twitter? (?)
[@ ^ 9.] ^^ Is there such a thing as a 'dating elo rating' (as in r/datingoverfifty)? Or lack-of-dating-thereof elo-rating? In a sense that, m, it could be probably related to why ''indie-crypto lifetime narrative' elo rating' is an overwhelm, compared to 'cryptocurrency elo rating' ... ? (?) (?) (?)
[@ ^ 9.1.] ^^ Maybe it's just 'living around women' elo (without involving any sort of 'dating' or 'datingoverfifty' or 'lack-of-dating',, yet ...)
[@ ^ 10.] ^^ Is there ''indie-crypto lifetime narrative' elo rating' (aka. 'elo rating' pertaining to 'indie-crypto narrative') 
[@ ^ 10.1.] ^^ That is seemingly unfortunately is 'overwhelm' of some 'unknown kind' (when you had 8-9k$ - this was not an overwhelm) so unfortunately go back to 'cryptocurency elo rating' and dwell there? (?)

[>] Насчет соседей -- типа ты не знаешь что ты в состоянии 'beyond self-disciplining' или нет ... потому что (1) 'эмбодимент' зависит от визитирования такого-или-иного -- норзерн квартерса ('immigration precisely to ramat-aviv was a matter of luck') ... (х/з может потому что там все-еще возможна работа близкая к программированию (каким-то е*нным макаром х/з хотя может и эмбодимент там тоже скоро 'исчезнет' мы не можем этого знать ...) ... и (2) ты не знаешь -- когда (если вообще) ты сможешь в следующий раз туда приехать/доехать (вот так вот ...)

I cannot find no documents in the filesystem, besides this document because I have 'money staked' for it ... so unfortunately this is yes this document unless I manage to completely lose money that is 'staked' for it ... and then I'm 'lost in filesystem' in petah tikva all-over-again.
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Point being, that if you have the 100$ money -- don't f*cking lose it ... do your utmost to not lose it. Money makes things easier. Whatever sh*t I'm in (or 'in for' ...)

[>] ^^ How I came to this section? [Try & Maintain existing] 'Katrain elo rating' (when lost & neurotic & cannot find yourself amidst 'floating in pink'/'pink brain'/'preagnant brain' .. ) ==> 'IFS elo rating' ==> 'Cults elo rating' (which is the same as 'ifs elo rating', right?) ==> 'Tai-chi/Martial Arts elo rating' ==> (resting day) ==> 'Bridge elo rating' ==> 'Cryptocurrency elo rating' ==> 'Indie-crypto elo rating' ==> '[Living with potenitally hostile] Women elo rating' ==> (When thinking of '[living with potentially hostile] women elo rating' then it f*cking backtracks to the 'hah, prove yourself!' aka 'the real katrain elo rating maintenance-of' ...

[>] One point of note, is, that 'boundaries between men' always exist, even on the topmost levels (e.g. 2 topmost competing presidents) so when really lost ... then you're really lost ... ==> This is less important ... the narrative is more about 'chess/baduk' helping me within nadine's group and henceforth ==> maintaining at least the same elo with katrain ... this way it's less 'sharp' in 'extreme states' (tbd1,,)

[@ ^ 5.] [WRITING_OWN_BADUK_KATAGO_LIKE_ENGINE_1] Writing own katago-like engine ==> and publishing it on github ... from scratch ... -- might borderline-help me study baduk as a-by-process and maintain my 'elo' at somewhat 'decent' level otherwise I just would not be able to write a decent engine.

[@ ^ 15.] [TALKING_ABOUT_KATRAIN_1] ^^ Telling to others about katrain might f*ck up your katrain elo rating, just like it did with chess ...
[@ ^ 15.1.] ^^ Sometimes getting outside of the 'feminism nonsense domination realm' (aka. home) into other gps locations could help, but needs self-organisation abilities like throw over-accumulated garbage, which, just doesn't happen.

[@ ^ 1.] ^ Sometimes a pc can capture my whole cross-board dragon - how is that ever possible? ==> Yeah, it's possible to surround a cross-board dragon ... just tried this myself with katrain human-human 9x9 board -- it's just like surrounding a side non-two-eyes-bunch of stones from 3 sides (because 4th side is off-board) ...

[#] Crypto voice overwhelm - worst come to worst -- protector questions here too ... (hope it holds) ...

[>] Are you protecting something?

[>] Is there something you want to show me?
[>] Is there something you still need from me, compared to previous time we talked?
[>] Is there something you want me to [<script name='know'>makeQuizElem2('a25vdw==','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>]?

Beta:
[>] Are you willing to look me in the eyes?
[>] Would you like to palpate me via 'groping', like a blindfolded person would?
[>] What are you holding for me? (Что ты для меня держишь?)
[>] Give it time to check you out and get to know you. (Дайте время на то, чтобы он смог [<script name='оценить'>makeQuizElem2('0L7RhtC10L3QuNGC0Yw=','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] и узнать вас.)

[>] Ask it, “What is it like to meet me?” (Спросите: «Каково это встретиться со мной?»)

Other-Beta (tbd1,,):
* What is this protector trying to protect me from?
* What does this protector believe about the situation or about me?
* What does this protector want me to do or not do?
* How does this protector make me feel?
* How does this protector help me or hurt me?

[Less frequent]:
[>] What would it be from ‘IFS’ & ‘Shame’ perspective?

[Related, but not ifs questions to parts ...]:
[>] Is there an 'uncontrollable/untameable running commentary' that 'just won't stop' ... -- lurking there somewhere?
[>] How dare you pinpoint at flaws at our perfect, exemplar neighborhoods? ==> Forgetting/’Flipping’ Words ==> Memory systems.
[>] 'Burned Bananas' help me a lot yet I keep forgetting about them ...
[>] Some Parts take beyond lifetime (100+ years) to unburden ...
[>] Parts Work Around NoFap ...
[>] When you're beyond 'self discipling' ==> You're a 'cult material' ...
[>] После пятой-шестой сигареты в день Я уже 'никакой' (regardless whether it's 'enjoyable' 'activity', 'a 'blessing'', or whatever ...)
[>] In some gps locations you are capable of being IFS therapist .. in some gps locations you are not capable of being IFS therapist. Transition between such locations costs a sh*t ton of money ... that even banano burn fails to work ... only much larger sums will do ...
[>] Worst come to worst - you could simply study the protector questions by repetition repeated reading ...

Discard with time (not for overwhelms):
[>] [Maybe not 1] Would you like a tour of my life today? ==> [not for overwhelms, might be insulting during f*cking overwhelms] 
[>] [Not for overwhelms] What does that original part want you to know about itself?
[>] What has the part been trying to do for you? (Что ты пытаешься для меня сделать?) ==> Again, maybe not for overwhelms, because it might get 'negative'

[>] Programming for 'bonding leverage' might not exactly work, because it would take ~ 20 years for it to turn to a 'bonding leverage' and I don't have that f*cking time ...

[#] Misc Notes - What comes after 'print 5+5' 

[>] So basically you're writing on paper your thoughts, and then there's a voice: 'write 'print 5+5'' ... so what do I do then? And does it really matter?
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Again, in a sense, it looks like the right direction here is to get tho fock out of the house due to 'r/MenGetRapedToo' dynamic that is definitely manifesting here ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ But let's say that you can't get outside due to some unforseen circumstance (something in the house needs to be fixed urgently or you're waiting urgently for someone, or there's some unforseen other circumstance e.g. you were in distress ... so you started writing your thougths on paper ... then a thought 'write me 'print 5+5' came', but when now you think about getting out -- the distress aren't 'gone' ... you're still in 'write thoughts on paper mode' and 'stuckness' whom you're trying to write onto paper - says: nope, not getting out!' ... -- so what do you do then? (In a sense of a 'print 5+5' thought?)
[>>> 1.1.1.1.] ^^ Because such situations did occur more than once to me.

[@ ^ 1.] ^^ So how do I 'continue' on that 'print 5+5' narrative? Let's say after few 'print 5+5''s in python repl prompt, you would next would want to probably write homebrew/weekend projects 'whatever you feel like' because 'disruptive technologies' and 'people are slowly 'catching up'' (aka. 'I'm having a fridge but everyone else have to go to the store and buy ice cubes' analogy) 
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ And henceforth it's important to rely on 'whatever you feel like' intuition because you innately feel where people might be 'slowly catching up'
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ Minecraft sign 32 bit is also a 'disruptive technology' and 'people are slowly catching up'

[@ ^ 2.] ^^ Next, you go into lesser-shitstorm indie crypto projects one of such would be a 'gmx.io' fork, that would allow for leverage trading practice mode, and would stop you from at least 'investing money into sh*tcoins' and _keep_ that 100$ in bitcoin for the sake of that document ...
[@ ^ 2.1.] ^^ Maybe also get into arbitrage bots ...
[@ ^ 2.2.] ^^ Also nano burn script might, m, be one of 'lesser-shitstorm' indie crypto projects (where is their medium doc)?
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Where 'homebrew' is not enough -- pummel them with 'crypto $$$$' ...

[@ ^ 3.] ^^ Worst case you go onto 'more shitstormish' indie crypt projects such as your own governatic chain, your own brown dust clone, tbd1,,
[@ ^ 3.1.] ^^ Your own decentralised datahoarder-services-for-money marketplace ... (?),, your own memrise clone for 'nft's',, your own 'Decentralised Coin Storage' minimalist PoW blockchain ...,,
[@ ^ 3.1.] ^^ But that still is imo better then dancing around for amberdao.io liquidity ... and ...
[@ ^ 3.2.] ^^ DCS (Decentralised Coin Storage) PoW coin (which allows non-native coins, but doesn't allow swaps, etc.)

[@ ^ 4.] ^^ Sw Projects around IFS -- forum, memrise clone (for ifs studying),,

[@ ^ 5.] ^^ Last but not least - you want to do 'dip' into father and/or michael excercise, just because conversations with them might be inevitable, and you want to have some 'safety-net' to resort to (regardless of legal/cult-mind-control/favoxil issues that I might or might not be able to resolve) ...

Onwards, Onto the finer detail (there are more finer subdivisions of 'homebrew', such as 'making order in filesystem' (in super-distress states)):

[@ ^ 1.] First of all you have to address the 'r/MenGetRapedToo' dynamic that is in the appartment building (otherwise you will get into 'paralyzis by analysis' mode without understanding what is going on ...
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ The subreddit has a list of books ... but the obvious first book is aflsd aka. 'Innocence Project' book and only then comes the 'Anatomy of Female Power' (?)
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ Secondly you have to somehow address the 'r/nofap' dynamic (because most likely you are sitting near the computer right now)
[@ ^ 1.1.1.1.] Also, you have to somehow address the 'r/datingoverfifty' dynamic ... 

[@ ^ 2.] ^^ Secondly you have to somehow address the 'r/nofap' dynamic (because most likely you are sitting near the computer right now)
[@ ^ 2.1.] ^^ 'Games complexity' & 'Shogi/Xiangqi' books right thereafter. Don't ask.

[@ ^ 3.] ^^ 'Human Depth Games complexity' books (don't ask) (see above).

[@ ^ 4.] Nosurf books.

[@ ^ 5.] Blockchain technologies books (first, second, and third reading is without any experiments, just read (for the sake of 'explosiveness'))

[@ ^ 6.] r/MenGetRapedToo - Chapter 2 ==> The 'what ifs cornered' states ... (where 'nothing works' aka even having done the tai-chi -- you cannot hyper-focus on j*ck sh*t)
[@ ^ 6.1.] ^^ Any 'female power' books you can find (not to 'debate' with women their 'female power' but to guide yourself (hopefully) out of that 'what-ifs-cornered' state) ...
[@ ^ 6.1.1.] ^^ Again, academic books on female power are probably more preferable because they are 'deeper' but also 'cults books' (because non-academic books sometimes get you into other 'sh*thole's).

[@ ^ 7.] Cults books (if reading 'female power' books for some other reason mentioned above).

[@ ^ 8.] Extreme Privacy && Identity Theft books (afraid of 'computer security' abyss)

[@ ^ 9.] ^^ How to pass exams books (studying chess is 'reading book' + 'puzzles'/'katrain' but then this also starts feeling relevant ...) 

tbd1,,

[@ ^ 4.] Poverty finance books (david ramsey?)

[@ ^ 8.] ^^ IFS Certification books help me talk to myself more coherently without being ashamed.
[@ ^ 8.1.] ^^ But 'voices' tell me that something should come 'before' those 'ifs books' ... (is it 'programming career' books?)

[@ ^ 5.] Offline retention of important information: is this site backed up offline somewhere? What's the password? Where's the password reminder?

Daytrading bitcoin: Bitcoin is probably the safest place to store airdropped & mined $$$ (due to 'less rugpullable smart contracts possbilities' and 'less human factor') but still is not the 'main unit of account' ... in a sense that you can ask 'how do you know that bitcoin doesn't go down now to 200$ per bitcoin?' when daytrading bitcoin, but you can't ask the inverse about usdc-to-bitcoin ratio when daytrading usdc.

[>] Regular User: A user that connected his wallet to the platform and did one transaction (e.g. swap). ==> This definitely is significant and decreases the chance of 'missing out on that airdrop' due to occurences of e.g. { 'aptos', 'uniswap' (2021), 'ampleforth' (2021),, tbd1 }

[@ ^ 3.] 'Daytrading and leverage trading'

[>] [INDIE_CRYPTO_NARRATIVE_1] 'Indie crypto narrative' for 'bonding leverage' for 'lipton tea' is always preferable to 'airdrop farming' for that same leverage ... you have staking coins and beyond that there are 2-3 significant airdrops per year -- jerkiness-hunting for last-minute opportunities is very very hazardous. If they pressure you with time - super hazardous.
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Not being afraid of [missing] some earning opportunities that end in two weeks if you don't 'hurry hurry hurry' ... you have staking coins.

[>] [INDIE_CRYPTO_NARRATIVE_1] Indie-crypto lifetime narrative (micro-steps / incremental-micro-pilots) is better for trauma regulation then 'airdrop beggarship' narrative, because when you're a 'loser' and 'neighbors knock' then 'indie crypto narrative' 'survives' better then 'f*ck it no more airdrops' narrative (in that sense I mean ...) 
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ But again, it's not as 'palpatable' as 'almost-feels-like-real money' which is in 'airdrop hunter' narrative ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ This doc, for one, wouldn't be as 'findable' if not for 'airdrop farming' or '1 cent a year' narrative ...

[>] [COMPLETION_STATUS_COLUMN_1] 2-3 major airdrops per year ... типа когда-то ты понимаешь что по статистике когда ты заработал 1k$-2k$-3k$ то когда тебе раз-в-год прийдет _может быть_ eще 1k$-2k$ (и/или с _большой_ редкостью - 4k$-20k$ -- что нехрена не обещанно и можно так 10 лет прождать и нехера такого больше не будет никогда) то типа понимаешь -- что время которое ты вкладываешь в это - оно становится все более и более бессмысленно и не стоит того - стоит просто сидеть как йог и медитировать -- и психику и так уже досконально до невозможности фрагментированную - не нарушать (хотя-бы этими дерганиями-идиотствами). Вообщем что Я хочу -- чтобы скажем выбрать 'нашумевший' пройект скажем какой-то L1 ... и обозначать ему 'комплетенесс-статус' типа вот типа Я сделал здесь 10 транзакций в течение 3-4 недель на одном кошельке -- заминтил нфт -- проголосовал за один говернанс пропозал -- может зделал гиткоин донейшн -- дискорд привязал к этому аккаунту -- и в основном теперь там комплишн статус он примерно 80% и вообще его больше не трогаем нахуй. Дропнет-дропнет ... не дропнет-не дропнет. Типа писать колоночку: комплишн статус.

[>] [EVMOS_STAKING_1] Evmos staking is only there to have 1$/week to invest into top-ten hinted/confirmed token projects. But don't expect from it astronomic returns. Otherwise it's trading. We are de-facto counting on $EVMOS not to go below 0.7$ (like polygon/matic, which is also a evm) (which is based on speculation) ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Beyond that ... we don't 'invest' into evmos. For like 1000$/month returns we know it's sh*t. Should evmos die/go below 0.7$ then probably find some other 100% blockchain and/or even if we could accumulate a big sum till then (e.g. 1000$ just invest it into some 20% cosmos token or other L1 token (not a protocol))

[>] Q. Daytrading bitcoin: Bitcoin is probably the safest place to store airdropped & mined $$$ (due to 'less rugpullable smart contracts possbilities' and 'less human factor') but still is not the 'main unit of account' ... in a sense that you can ask 'how do you know that bitcoin doesn't go down now to 200$ per bitcoin?' when daytrading bitcoin, but you can't ask the inverse about usdc-to-bitcoin ratio when daytrading usdc.

[>] You're going to lose access to this document again (b/c lose 100$ btc via amplified 100x loss factor) ...

[>] ^^ Remember you can't invest into crypto from outside sources!!! Daytrading you get 'liquidated' and then again 'liquidated' and then again you'll invest the last 100$ from bitcoin into there ... and then what? This document then becomes an ordinary document in filesystem again!

Wtf -- ... and yakovenko ... ok ... I need here some mortage to pay ... hmm.

[>] ^^ You'll last longer (I understand that sometimes you don't want that, but in a good sense ...) if you just keep investing 3$/week for airdrops lottery.
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ You depend on every piece of crypto (even $200 is good. $400 is better. $800 is even better. 10x losses are terrifying.)

[>] [GAMBLER_BIAS_1] The reason leverage trading probably won't work in the longer term -- is because of 'human psychology' aka. the 'gambler bias' ('I'm always right! I can't be wrong! Just look at all the successful trades I've made in the past!... I just can't be wrong! ==> Invest more. ==> There's no 'lower bound' to the money you can and will invest. Or is there?).

[>] [NO_LOWER_BOUND_1] No lower bound (aka. where do you stop your losses)? At $100 loss? At $200 loss? Every $ in crypto is an important bonding leverage.

[>] [EXTREME_DEMENTIA_1] Secrert-Crypto is more like for the case that when you 'lost your hanging rope in some closet' 'forgot where you shoved it' ... and 'cannot find ... cannot find ...' ... and ..

(I cannot, m, even here say, m, that the fear of 'extreme dementia' fear -- will be 'enough' -- to self-discipline myself.
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ Even after you've invested in perps -- document everything! Documenting everything helps 'cut losses' or at least so my and 'Groovy Guy''s hunch says ...

[>] One way to stop losses is to 'not lose martial arts narrative' entirely ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ I think that airdrops are enough to maintain $100 for this document (at least for next few years, after aptos airdrop). Do not go deeper.

[>] [SURVIVORSHIP_BIAS_PROFESSOR_COIN_1] "I had a professor who had the class stand up and all start flipping coins. If you flipped tails you sat down and stopped. After several iterations he interviewed the last remaining standing person to ask him what hard work he did to become such a good coin flipper, and if he had any secrets about coin flipping success he wanted to share with the class. It was a pretty nice exercise and I think applicable generally to the hero-worship that often surrounds successful people." <==> This doesn't apply to 'leverage trading' specifically -- but to any trading ...

After all, if I can't sense the difference between 'prison' and 'freedom', I cannot say 'bla bla if you leverage trade, you'll go to prison!' to mysel (because, again, like, f*ck! I _enjoy_ prison! ...) ...?
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ So, umm, how exactly do I prevent myself from deteriorating into leverage trading, in gps locations where I'm 'beyond self-disciplining'? (?)

[>] [INCAPABLE_OF_ACCEPTING_THE_LOSS__SYNDROME_1] ^^ You are incapable of 'accepting the loss' -- like you were incapable with fire emblem heroes (!!) -- now think trading or 'leverage trading' (!!)

[@ ^ 1.] ^ Eventually, even now I believe that sooner or later it will come back to it's original price (within a day or two, with ~ 90% probability) but the problem is, that during all that 'anticipation' time ... I will be in 'trainwrecked' non-calm neurosis-resembling state. Which I don't ever, ever, ever ever need. In my already, m, almost 'silkom' situation ... 
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ Now the 'brave' thing, is to 'accept the loss, and sell in this very minute, right?' (?)
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] [2022.11.16 10:57] ^^ Want to cut the losses now, to be able not to lose access to this document ...
[@ ^ 1.1.1.1.] ^^ Playing brown dust, langrisser, and worst case skyweaver are less likely than trading to make me 'lose' this document ... than jup.ag and/or gmx.io ...

(at least for now that's my opinion on how those states 'beyond white worms' should be, umm, best related to ...) ...
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ Again the backing idea behind watching cults videos for 'beyond white worms' states -- is ... --- that such states could potentially set you up for 'signing an infinite year contract with scientology's sea org' ... 'and then after 35 years come out bashing the, umm, david miscavige' which would be 'more bad than good' ... as simply as that ...

[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Point being that life is full of unexpected sharp falls (like zygo 'ostrov'-movie-style mistake) but still, probably, thinking 'ahh ph*ckk it, this life is all about 'luck factor' anyway no matter how hard you innerly try' is probably not the 'least bad trajectory' of when faced with choices.
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ Or at least when you're in such prolonged state of 'f*ck i tried so hard and mishap stiked me and all my efforts were in vain ... so ... wtf bother ... next zygomatic-fracture grade fall is around the corner anyway' - trembling to 'snap out' of such state and trying for outside gps's.

[>] Women: In a sense that if you say that 'bla bla being in a cult for 35 years and denouncing david miscavige of his kind' later on is also a shitty living and 'least bad trajectory' could be still to 'keep hanging' like this then after some time of watching a cult video/podcast an impending doom arises that, m, the women/dudayev issue is unadressed in this, m, so-called 'least bad trajectory' state -- and it is yes sharp and it will yes keep resurfacing ... to the extent that it will 'break me' and not enough to think 'aaa, people in cults even gave birth because the leader just told them so' and then 'treated their children like unrelated objects' ... and it will still most likely will 'break' me ... like, wtf ... in 'wtf, I'm not normal' sense ... so f*ck that -- still going to david miscavige like cult and fack ya all ya scamma!
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ So in that sense the 'strengthener' might be to yes watch 'mra documentaries' and podcasts and get 'late age' context from there too (not only from 'cults documentaries' ...) as that also could help me friction that 'f*ck this all - still need a cult here even though they warned agains those' ... e.g. maybe siphon even more context of 'how people were miserable with women' to 'stabilise' the dick instincts ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ Goal: gather context to protect yourself from 'loser' innuendo (or 'loser overwhelm' innuendo) ... and keep doing self-ifs or whatever's more potent / more resonant than ifs for inner (and dudayev's) (and maybe ancestral generational etc.) traumas ...

[#] Polarization: Father and Gush Agadol Polarization (or maybe more than one) [pls don't change this header - it's referenced in somewhere else.]

Preamble: So first of all - there are 2 or three polarizations here

[>] Polarization [#5.1]: I feel like on one hand I wanted myself to move to ramat aviv and now I'm delaying and want to 'repent' my 'slow gathering' by doing him a programming excercise as a safety net (but that was when I had 8-9k$ do-kwon money 'safety net' but now sbf is bankrupt too if that's of any help)
[@ ^ 1.] ^ In a sense, I feel a sense of 'guilt' for not doing to him his excercise (if havent during a week made any progress).

[>] Polarization (or many polarisations) [#5.2]: He is threatening me now with a court order to vacate me forcefully out of petah-tikva, yet I myself have a _very deep_ blended parts that are not even _willing_ to go into that terrtory (one of them says: 'you need more crypto to open that sh*t [discussion] up' (crypto, that I don't have, and unable to systematically/methodologically get (who knows what amber price will be (could be as well 250$)) ... to the extent that, m, 'm-kay ... we're going into the ward once more!' (as in 'I had serious cptsd trauma ... they will be checking me up' and making me even more cripple in the process with their 'extensive tests' ...))

Preamble 2 - describing as thoroughly as possible - my current psychological and/or cohesiveness situation

[>] First of all with the assumption of 'r/MenGetRapedToo' subreddit existence, supposedly I could somewhat stay barely above the 'I enjoy rape in prison' state (which nullifies any desire whatsoever) (including the desire that emanates from this very body) to move to 'gush agadol' 'jascha heifetz' appartment.
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Again this is still very, m, fragile fact because traveling to ramat aviv every 72 hours to 'replenish that aflsd && r/MenGetRapedToo reservoir' will be harder now, due to rains, etc.
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ As I've said above, 'I enjoy rape in prison' state _nullifies any desire whatsoever_ (including transition to any 'jascha heifetz' what-mind-you) so I'm more like, m, in a post-trauma state of a  'sack' that just 'metaphorically' 'rots in his own feces' (no offense, I'm just trying to be 'didactic' here (so I could understand myself the next time I read those text ...)

[>] ^^ To emphasize, when I'm in 'rape in prison enjoy' state, I literally don't care about any, m, and don't even _object_ to some 'additional tests' that 'those people' in psych ward will do to me ... in fact - I'd rather _enjoy_ it ...
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ How in practice that would play out? -- G-d knows! ... But I suppose, eventually at some early stage of hospitalisation I'll feel that 'ashpala sidratit' vibes by other 3 people in the room and will want out ... (but again, this is like we've described earlier - the 'recurrent isolator' 'fingers-in-the-isolator-socket' phenomenon) ...
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ I can't really ... even now ... blended parts ... nobody will care there about neither 'blended parts' nor ifs or/and probaby I will forget about ifs altogether for the time being ...
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ But again - the guess is -- that trauma is so deep and the unblending work that is needed is so f*cking massive, that not sure that during lifetime, less to say during father constrained-time that he wishes for -- will I be able to unblend those ... so this is like a lottery -- will they hospitalise? won't they hospitalise? -- it's really a 'lottery-grade' question, due to the super-mega complexity of the current situation.

[>] ^^ On the third note, when I'm thinking about describing that very situation to him, and asking him for further help, to avoid the aforementioned hospitalisation, I get vibes like 'это будет ошибка, идиот!' from my parts (that are probably blended in some clusterfuckiada, without them realising, that actually the hospitalisation is the one, that will fuck me up even thousand millions times more, that after it - I'll get tens of thousands of more parts and complexities and complications (because saintars are harsh (we remember it - can't take away the memory (at least (?))) ...
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ So then again here question comes to: so parts tell me 'это ошибка, идиот!' невзирая на предстоящую катастрофу (напоминает мне 'deer-in-headlights' state ...) ... and they are 'resilient' to the extent that I can't 'bypass' them, now can I? (Without actually 'meeting' 'friendly' 'sanitars' for the second time)?

Preamble 3 - Doing programming work to 'checkmate' his part that is trying to prove that I'm 'mentally incapable' via 'programming assignments' is a 'no-go'

[>] Doing any programming work to 'checkmate' his ifs-part that is trying to prove that I'm 'mentally incapable', via 'programming assignments' is impossible, and I cannot utilize OpenAI for that purpose ...

Preamble 4 - Focus on getting to 8-9-20k$ in the next 5-6 years (wtfs and elaborations)

[>] So basically we've said that this [hope], so far is the only thing that holds us from, m, total irreluctance to whether a psychitatric hosptialisation will be or will not be ...
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ I assume that I have written dtao already today, before modifying this section further ...
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ Supposedly when I have 8-9-20k$ -- then some ifs-part of me will feel enough 'safety' ['safety-net'] that it will be able to 'open up' to me ... (and without that/those part(s) opening up to me -- it's all -- 'psychiatric institution -- no psychiatric institution --> don't f*cking care jo f*ckking bit ...' ...) ... otherwise, with current 'safety net' conditions -- it doesn't feel safe enough to open up to me -- so we're proactively, then, 'rowing' towards that direction (again, after having written all the previous dtao's that I devised earlier on, today (at current '2022.xx.xx' date)) ...

[>] ^^ So what's the best for the 'psychiatric hospitalisation irreluctance' --> focus on '8-9-20k$' in '5-6 years' OR focus on { maintaining the same level of ELO (and not 'degrading') vs. 'cryptocurrencies'} ?

[>] ^^ This goal (8-9-20k$ in crypto) is supposedly 'doesn't hurt nobody' or has to do with any 'specific' people but rather: _anonymously_ doing some specific activities, that some certain people (ceo's of dapp & ecosystem startups) whom I _don't even know face-to-face_, hint at, without ever knowing them face-to-face or having to interact with them one single bit.

[>] So far, the sense is ... that after having written the 'frontal collision' 'o-wgiph/o-wbiph' and realised that the part that says: 'The damage that is done is so f*****g huge already ... that another, second hospitalization, doesn't not really make any difference' (in contrast to the damage that has already been done) (e.g. is negligible in the face of the already existing vast damage) ... so far the sense is to 'keep trembling for 'frontal collision with sanitars'' ...

[>] ^^ Due to 'virulent & cautistic' cptsd critic that keeps being 'pervasive', thought of devising the following dtao: how bad is to 'talk to father about chess' in perspective of (amidst impending danger of) 'second psychiatric hospitalization' ... ==> so like:
[@ ^ 1.] Dtao: ('talking to father about chess') ('amidst impending danger of') ('second psychiatric hospitalization')

Preamble 6 - tbd1,,

----
[>] Theoretically with the assumption of existence of current crypto funds, gains.trade practice mode existence - 

[>] 

[>] So far what am I doing right now, is 24/7 trying to, m, 
[>] First let's start with the 
Preamble 2 - what tbd1,,

[>] ^ It's difficult to do father's programming excercise when you realise how much he & michael & kanevsky et. al. f*cked you ... so how exactly do you want to do to him his f*cking excercise - he tho f*kkk did it! Destroyd my programming career! With his 'the parks here are ok' gaslight!
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ But then the problem is that you yourself need ramat aviv for whatever's leftover is left off 'programming job' because in petah-tikva under 'crowdedness' (they just don't understand what a quietness environment is -- is's beyond the reach of their grasp (and it sort of can be yes understood somewhat -- you need a 'medical clown' profession in 'extremely cramped' environments etc etc etc.) it's just not possible to ever code and the government don't care - he just say -- you can't find a job - then you're a f*cking invalid. It's not our responsibility that the neighborhoods are 'cramped' - says the [<script name="government">makeQuizElem2('Z292ZXJubWVudA==', '&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>]. 'Get along!' - says the government. So it is strictly my 'operation grandma' or whatever you want to call it under the 'dumb boar' government (just like steven king wrote in his 1963 book about american government whilst comparing it to a russian 'bear hug' government.) ...

[>] ^^ You do talk to him on the phone do you? ==> So this is a f*cking coherence problem right there!

[>>> 1.1.] ^^ А с другой стороны ты явно чувствуешь нутром { 'subtle power plays' / 'subtle coercion dynamics' / tbd1 } all around you - for which - martial arts and nothing else - are yes indicated.

[>] ^^ Or is there even a 'polarisation'? (?)
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Addl (second part of polarisation if there even is a polarisation): 'I'm always surrounded by dogs',, 'It all comes down to force (or else it's sand-in-the-eyes)',, 'Government-backed feminism nonsense overwhelm' ,,

[>] ^^ Basically on one hand: you know, or at least the 'photogenic' younger you - knew -- that 'it all comes down to force no shit and there's no way you're gonna convince me otherwise' ... and henceforth martial arts are completely legit, and worth to die for rather than skip a bjj class.
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ On the other hand, you've said: wtf those martial arts are worse than prison ... even after prison some people get out perfectly photogenic! And this!?!?!? -- Look what this one did to me!?!?!?!
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ But again ... on the very low level gut level -- you still feel that, umm, martial arts are still 'valid' even after a horrific aesthetic injury that some crazy (or hostile) guy in there did to you ... so you're trying 'not to lose' the martial arts narrative 'entirely' and even though tai-chi could be by many accounts considered a laughable form of martial arts by many ... self-rehearsed chin-na is better than no-chin-na at all (or something along these lines)

[>] Martial arts that are done entirely in your head - is a 'mental masturbation' so I suppose some sort of 'dance meditation' with some random not-necessarily-effective martial moves mimicking - if you could do it every (or almost every day) -- you could at least say: 'I [<script name="tried my best">makeQuizElem2('dHJpZWQgbXkgYmVzdA==','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] not to lose martial arts narrative' compared to if you just done them in your head. 
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Because again, the 'it all comes down to force no shit and there's no way you're gonna convince me otherwise' frame still makes at least _some_ sense ... I 'sense' it every f*cking day in some certain gps locations especially ... those subtle, hidden, but definitely 'sensed' 'power plays' ... and even though the format of 'thrill-driven rolling with few partners every week' format - is overwhelming or even would, if properly researched, turn out to be medically incorrect, in a sense that 'thrill' perhaps should not be mixed into a weekly training due to burnouts and injuries (like the one that I had with some fractured bone) 
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ even though the format might turn out to be not correct for all populations -- until it is 'corrected' and such form of 'trauma-aware martial art' would be prominent all over the world and 5-10 clubs in tel aviv would open (like there's now with bjj) ... -- until then I at least do tai-chi kata as to not to lose martial arts narrative entirely ... 'лучше синица в руке чем журавль в небе' итп ...
[>>> 1.1.1.1.] ^^ I wouldn't be the one to do it because - or who knows -- but at least do a f*cking tai-chi excercise daily you can do (and smoking) -- so first pls establish a consistent tai-chi regular activity (without smoking) -- and then and only then you could worry about 'opening your own trauma aware dojo' (but if you start smoking once again -- then close theere fokkr dojo again) ...

To Recap:
[>] Q. Why just copy-catting jwing ming chin-na books and dvd's into your head - is not enough and you should do some stupid tai-chi kata? ==> 'Don't lose martial arts entirely' narrative is not kept then, if it's all done in your head .. e.g. if you assume that, m, a laptop/pc is an 'extension of human brain' ...

[#] Мои прорывы к ifs-терапевту (IFS Therapist Crawling mode)...

What else to do (besides nothing):

[>] [TREMBLE_FOR_1] Emergency Response Group #1: 'Tremble' for yourself whilst in this mode ... (because it's too f*cking close to 'coercive psychiatry' already) ...

[>] [MOVE_TO_WRITING_1] Emergency Response Group #2: Also, try to 'accentuize' on moving things and thoughts to paper as quickly as possible (if ever possible) (because 'Groovy guy' said so) (as hopefully should be with ifs therapist (or any other therapist (over the long term (they don't like legal threats (kind of scared of them ...))))) ...
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Discarding paper and 'paper security' also belongs here but as a first response to 'ifs therapists crawling mode' - it's 'out of scope' in/within this situational 'crawl' context (so for now leaving 'clog' to some other later 'emergency response group') -- but nevertheless should be hopefully taken care of somehow, anyhow, at a later time. etc.

[>] [CHESS_GO_ELO_LEVEL_SAME_1] Emergency response Group #3: Chess/Go ==> Things will inevitably slip with ifs therapist, the less slipped -- the better (the less years of hospitalization period afterwards, etc.) (IFS Therapist is yes close to hospitalization).

[>] [THIS_VERY_DOCUMENT_1] Emergency response group #4: Not losing this document via leverage-trading et. al. so when the next time I'm 'triggered'/'flashbacked' ==> I'll have access to this very list in my head.

[>] Emergency response group #18, tbd1: Paper security (maybe this is not even an 'emergency response' but 'post-lateral response')
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ There's also 'paper security' issue whereas you cannot properly articulate your thoughts if you can't write words like 'kill' or 'sucidide' on paper.
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ There's substitution db, but also there's 'paper disposal' procedure stuckness through which you won't be able to trust yourself, to write next piece of conversation with ifs therapist on paper, if it's get clogged in the house, for everyone to see. You just won't trust, will say 'a, ph*ck it!' and will move on onto talking to him _without paper_ (whether you had a proper paper disposal routine in place, or you did not).

==> (Совсем забыл. Сломался стакан.) Где-то да найдем его. Аминь.

[>] Also, try to 'accentuize' on moving things and thoughts to paper as quickly as possible (if ever possible) (because 'Groovy guy' said so) (as hopefully should be with ifs therapist (or any other therapist (over the long term (they don't like legal threats (kind of scared of them ...))))) ...

Common Why's:
[>] Тело мое не подчиняется мне - в том плане что Я требую от него чтобы оно не курило - а оно всеравно затягивается сигаретами ... в упор ... Я потерял над ним (над своим телом) контроль ...
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ И поэтому хочу к ифс терапевту прорваться Я ради спасения своей же жизни (чтобы хотя бы не к психиатру когда угожу - чтобы был у меня ифс - терапевт хотя бы раз в месяц.)
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ Я в упор чувствую что с каждой сигаретой мой организм все слабеет (это достаточно заметно) ... и просто сижу в терроре что вот сейчас сейчас что-то  [<script name='невыносимой болью'>makeQuizElem2('0L3QtdCy0YvQvdC+0YHQuNC80L7QuSDQsdC+0LvRjNGO','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] зажмет ...

// [>] Is 'ifs therapists' portal - open?

[>] Q. How the f*ck do I assert asking from him money for ifs therapists? So I'd have that 'safety net'? (?)
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ How? How?

Post-amble:
[>] Q. How the f*ck does ever 'ifs therapist crawling mode' ever spark during out of f*cking nowhere in the middle of the day? ==> Evidence-flipping socially-proofed knockos (who play football nearby). ==> The fear is very real: 'он ударился об дубинку санитара' // 'он стукнул в нос нашу бедную собачку' // 'he's yelling weirdly all the time and we are afraid what he might do to our children (especially the female gender)' // (tbd1) ==> And henceforth a natural reaction is to find the group 'backup' of your own (that could verify your 'side' of the story).

Or like Pete Walker said, if CPTSD were accepted, the DSM would only be a couple of pages long. \n\nI myself have BPD, and, obviously (to me) CPTSD. This was after years of being misdiagnosed, really resonating with the CPTSD diagnosis, but realizing some of my symptoms were making it very hard to have relationships or function in society in a pleasant way.\n\nI LOVE reframing these disorders as complex and even needed reactions to trauma, but I see a big problem in CPTSD communities and in communities where people had trauma.\n\nThe biggest problem I see seems to fit in really well with cluster B traits. On the extreme end, in certain places where people talk about narcissism and being abused by narcissism, I see a lot of black and white thinking, victim narrative, good vs bad, etc. \n\nNPD is a serious disorder, and while many people have narcissistic traits, including healthy people, for society to all of a sudden think that anyone who harmed them has NPD and can be cast off into \u201cbad\u201d category is disheartening. \n\nIt\u2019s not NEARLY as bad on this subreddit, don\u2019t get me wrong. But this subreddit lacks something other mental health subreddit have\u2014which is personally responsibility. When we have an emotional flashback, we react in not-normal ways to a small trigger someone else might do. This is really just rephrasing cluster B traits, which could for instance involve splitting and dissociation. I love the way it\u2019s rephrased, it allows us forgiveness for ourselves and allows us to understand what is happening. But we need MORE than that.\n\nWe must move beyond the victim complex, we must take responsibility for our actions, we must fight to not let this illness keep us where we are. In the beginning, I thought CPTSD was the best diagnosis ever, because it stopped stigmatizing those with trauma and let the world know that it really wasn\u2019t our fault.\n\nBut the longer I was stuck, the more I realized that the reason I loved it so much was it furthered reinforced the victim narrative in my head and that I was the \u201cgood guy\u201d while my abusers were \u201cbad guys.\u201d (I am not claiming anyone should forgive abusers. The healthiest thing imo would be to understand they are in the grey and view them with nuance, but still say they have no place in your life.) \n\nIt IS healthy and, I think when fully integrated, will be the absolute best diagnosis going forward. I did a ton of healing and work that helped me grow that I don\u2019t think would\u2019ve been possible without the label to understand it.\n\nBut at one point, I had developed self love, forgiven myself, but was still exhibiting these maladaptive behaviors that, frankly, were quite toxic. I think we need to integrate both self healing, forgiveness, understanding, etc with pragmatic ways to healthily interact with the world. \n\nWe need to understand that many of the ways we learned to cope are, in fact, toxic. This isn\u2019t fair, but it\u2019s the truth. It\u2019s why so many of us grapple with the abuse our parents places on us. Because we see that they were suffering, but that suffering does not negate toxicity. \n\n I see a lot of people rejecting cluster b diagnoses and/or demonizing then. Those are OUR people. The reason these are so heavily stigmatized is not because of the \u201clabel\u201d but because how traumatized people respond to the world. If CPTSD does replace these diagnoses, CPTSD will also be stigmatized. People stigmatize the ugly, trauma responses that we\u2019ve learned to use, not the name of our disorder. \n\nMy hope is that helping people understand that our responses are DUE to trauma will help reduce the stigma and bring some compassion. It\u2019s more about explaining why we do these things. But anti-social coping mechanisms are toxic regardless. It isn\u2019t fair, but if we want to heal we must take responsibility, accept who we are, and fight against this every day. It is not enough to reframe our experience with self love. We also must work on living with and loving others in healthy ways.",

Ref:

For example, Sheila might locate a part of her that wants harmony with her husband no matter what. [In addition to the part that is angry with her husband]. She would access that part and hear what it has to say. This would help her to realize that there is more to her than the Temper Tantrum Part. She would then find a place inside her that is neither the Temper Tantrum Part nor the Harmony Part. This is likely to be Self."""

[>] ^^ Youtube: 8shZvkxyAyY

[>] Q. What will happen if I talk about this excercise to the police (like I'd want to do with stephane)? ==> ?
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ What's the 'underlying dynamic that is involved here'? ==> That I cannot study 'situational stuckness' 'polarisation resolving' excercises of any kind whatsoever? Or what? (?)
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ How does that yulia's polarisation resolving excercise relate to 'no-bad-parts frame rupture'?

[>] [CRAWL_TOWARDS_IFS_THERAPISTS_1] Q. How does yulia's excercise relate to 'crawling towards ifs therapists'? ==> Still can't beat 'evidence-flipping' 'socially proofed' shuhrik!
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ With all that said, still hunting airdrops for 100$ in bitcoin for the purpose of finding this document ... - is overwhelming information activity and just focusing on 'varlakova' excercise && 'shuhrik' is not enough? (?) (unless you believe that bitcoin won't go into 0.00001$ never? (?)) ==> For expansion see below: 'Yulia Varlakova excercise and '100$ in bitcoin' information overwhelm'

[>] [100_IN_BITCOIN_1] Yulia Varlakova excercise and '100$ in bitcoin' information overwhelm ==> We said, that for this document to 'hold' -- we need 100$ in bitcoin ... and so we're still hunting airdrops (or should we?) I mean the probability is very low that I won't have 100$ in bitcoin in the next 10-20 years. Are we addressing that problem properly (e.g. via hunting new airdrops?)
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Common sense point 1: So generally you shouldn't invest more than ~20-30 minutes a day into new airdrop hunting, with the premise that I have enough money now to sustain 100$ bitcoin for next 10 years for sake of this document.
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ But there's limitless 'bonding leverage' problem! E.g. there's never enough 'bonding leverage' ==> You will most likely not attain this bonding leverage by airdrop-hunting for 8+ hours a day since this is an overwhelming, burnout-ish, and menual task (which has many chinese-farmers competitors) -- aka the 'investments-vs-results' problem.
[@ ^ 1.2.] ^^ With that said, if you were 'compulsively' on twitter today for 20-30 minutes already -- then supposedly today you have 'farmed' 'enough' (?) (and it's like, that, more 'organisedness' needs to be 'breathed in' (again, unless it's somewhat emergency, USDC crashed and you had to swap all wallets to dai).

[>] Varlakova excercise and 'hole in IFS'
[@ ^ 1.] If you have both 'No Bad Parts Frame rupture' _and_ 'you have no sugardaddy or a money for ifs therapist' ==> Then it's a 'hole' in 'ifs model'
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ It is a 'bad' hole (remember r/MenGetRapedToo?) in a sense that it introduces 'instability' and most likely 'unexpected bad (or bald (had to write the 'bald' here for some reason ...) surprises'
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ One ultra-superficial solution to this is study both {{ 'mozaic mind' (aka. 'ifs certification' books } and { 'smart contracts' / 'ida pro' / 'reactos' / 'programming methodology that separates me from a 12 year old smart contract developer' books } } ... 
[@ ^ 1.1.1.1.] If it's just a 'mozaic mind' then it's 1000 more broken tooth ahead (because you 'jumped trains at full speed' / 'do not stop something that works until something better came along' proverbs etc.) 
[@ ^ 1.1.1.1.1.] ^^ From the varlakova perspective though, it makes 'varlakova' excercise much more important because it can be done even when bankrupt. (It is ifs-approved (and academically peer-reviewed --> 500 ifs therapists will 'accept' (?) that excercise ...)
[@ ^ 1.1.1.2.] In regard to programming ==> programming has a 'stuckness point' at 'r/MenGetRapedToo' (and possibly 'r/nofap')

[>] [TAI_CHI_1] Varlakova excercise and tai-chi kata (after 6PM)
[@ ^ 1.] ^ It's very difficult (?) to prove the existence of 'forceful coercion' (or to 'deduce' 'forceful coercion' from perpetual knockors' noise -- some [ifs] part just says - 'no - I don't agree that it's a 'coercion' ...' ...) ==> So can't 'deduce' 'not abandoning martial arts narrative entirely' strictly from knocko-couch-draggers unfortunately (whilst respecting ifs principle of 'no bad parts') ... ==> ?
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^ [It was erased, but] you could without 'going directly against knockos' say that I get weird 'I enjoy rape in prison' states, (in certain, specific gps locations) ==> and then, should due to some weird perversiveness, things arrive to a real rape in prison scenario ==> arrive to that prison's rapist, knowing some chin-na (when facing that prison rapist) ... because I might not like it when he literaly starts touching my body (even though I desired it earlier) ... so I have at least some, m, 'safety net'/'kill switch' (so to speak) .. 
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^ After all If I read from r/MenGetRapedToo ==> There are some topics { "Does anyone else feel filthy and need to shower constantly?",, "I keep setting myself up for assault",, (tbd1) } which don't seem to be describing 'pleasureable'/'enjoyable'/'desireable' states at all ==> those topics do not look sympathetic at all!
[@ ^ 1.1.1.1.] ^ Dance Element of Tai-chi: It _feels_ like, martial arts that are totally 'in your head' - do still implicate that you have yes 'given up entirely on martial arts narrative' ... so memorising chin-na books only is not enough (if 'books only' then it sort of implies that 'yes given on martial arts narrative entirely') ==> so there has to be at least some 'out-of-your-head-only' activity adjacent to it ... ==> So far tai-chi aka 'dancing out martial arts moves in a 'wishwashy' way' fits the bill. It doesn't mean though, that after those 'wish-washy' moves, you want to stop and not pursue further the real studying of a more 'precise' (and not a 'wish-washy') versions of martial arts chin-na and ground chin-na maneuvers (now, that it's not 'entirely in your head' (for that day, after tai-chi that was done during that day, ...)) ...
[@ ^ 1.1.1.1.1.] ^^ But again, if you feel burned out enough from tai-chi alone ... then fack ya fack ya fack ya -- at least let it be tai-chi alone ... (and not a total 'abandon of martial arts subject entirely whatsoever' ...) ...
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ Since varlakova's excercise resembles stephane closely ==> 'Stephane Ball won't open / Protector won't step aside' (and on the other hand 'IFS therapists' have 'ban' - so at least to keep & maintain self-ifs option (need 'safety' for 'stephane ball to open' (and to sh*t up about stephane even for a second prison term)) ...
[@ ^ 3.] ^^ I wrote already that I 'enjoy' rape in prison, but there's one thing that I still do not enjoy, and that is 'ifs therapists ban' vs. 'sleep doctor's final verdict incoherence' (even though it's 'looking too long into an abyss' and 'sleep doctor' shouldn't be involved never) ... but nevertheless ... then at least I can say when '100x leverage trading' ... that 'I will end up 'in-between-chairs' in regard to { 'ifs therapists ban' vs. 'sleep doctor's final verdict incoherence' } ... if I keep { 100x leverage trading like that } ...' but again the connection is not fully apparent (tbd1,,)
[@ ^ 3.1.] ^^ So anyway the relation of tai-chi kata && chess to { ifs therapists } is that 'ifs is a cult' and with cult leader you deal via { 'playing chess with cult leader' && 'doing martial arts vs cult leader' (aka . not abandoning martial arts narrative entirely ...) } ... so henceforth a tai-chi connection to { 'some discernable activity that I do not 'enjoy' (like I for 'rape in prison' would ...) and 'want to avoid' } ... (?)
[@ ^ 4.] Toxic Shame is academically recognised as a toxic phenomenon (see internalguides.net) and sometimes fighting toxic shame requires 'manifesting non-comformism' (yelling in weird places, dressing sometimes inappropriately, etc.) ... and non-comformists are going to be 'pecked on' (remember that parenting.stackexchange.com post?) -- if you are not confident enough in your ability to 'back' 'non-comformism' (martial arts) then there's inability to manifest noncomformism which things get 'accumulated' inside to the extent that 1000 depot shots won't help.
[@ ^ 4.1.] ^^ So basically: 'Childhood trauma' ==> 'Toxic Shame' ==> Need 'nonconformism' (aka. yelling 'freedom' 'way too more often for the police's taste') to 'plow through' that toxic shame (or otherwise things will get 'clogged up' and no depot shots will help) ==> Noncomformists will be always, always pecked at (tbd1, https://parenting.stackexchange.com/questions/21393/impact-on-kids-not-having-tv (*1)) ==> Bjj & tai-chi & shibashi to 'back up' my 'non-comformisms' ('wtf ya')
[@ ^ 4.1.1.] (*1) "I think the question can be generalized to any form of non-conformism. People not fitting into the so-called "norm" will always be picked-on by some others, if not because of the TV? it will be clothes, music or simply physical difference. So it would basically depend on how far are you ready to go with "non-conformism" and how you would deal with possible problems happening..."
[@ ^ 4.1.2.] ^^ You end up like mr. fredricksen but at least less hospitalizations (?)
[@ ^ 5.] There is a 'hole' in 'IFS' in a sense that, m, when you have 'no bad parts frame rupture' and also 'are bankrupt' ... you can't m, just go to 'ifs therapist' or possibly even zoom chat on the cellphone (because you have no cellphone) ... and then you have to work on some menial job to get that cellphone and internet connection ... and in menial jobs there is a lot of 'autorative power abuse' ... and that's where 'martial arts' (or memorised bjj (worst case trust some book written by some bjj sparring champion)) become very important ...
[@ ^ 5.1.] ^^ Maybe also here need to self-study 'how to pass exams' book by dominic obrien because that whole 'studying via 1000 repetitions' vs. 'studying via memory palace pegging system' is a one huge 'burnout and overwhelm' headf*ckery and want 'optimal result here' in a sense that I have in my head most of bjj & chin na books contents without as much headfuckery as possible (maybe actually '1000 repetitions over time' will cause greater 'most bjj & chin-na' books in my head then indulging in 'how to pass exams' headf*ckery in the first place) ...
[@ ^ 5.1.1.] ^^ But memorisation systems sometimes (at some 'situational moments') seem *super, super* important and as if it's a 'deal breaker' without them. So welcome to the new headf*ckery realm! (But for now just do the 'base-touching'/'palpating' distress books (?) [2022.11.25]).

[>] Varlakova excercise and tai-chi incoherence (you're doing it but not re-watching or re-reading it)
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Worst case, read fiction book (tbd1,,)
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ Copy-cat random comparing between own summarised (own prepared 'images with red arrows designating movement directions' summaries) material, and 'book' (e.g. over-the-days checks, whilst labeling: '[last-date-check: 2022.02.02]' as goes with 'distress books' right now ...)
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ The assumption is that own summaries are better than videos (because it's at least scrollable pdf with a more-readily-searchable content than videos) ...
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Today skipping,, no crypto,, [2022.11.25]

[>] [GAMES_1] Varlakova excercise and playing any games whatsoever (even the more-trollable ones) after 6 PM ==> ?
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Since in some certain gps locations the discernance between 'prison' and 'freedom' is lost, the only discernance that is left is { 'ifs therapists ban' vs. 'sleep doctor's final verdict incoherence' } aka it is the only one thing that I don't 'enjoy' (as compared to 'rape in prison', which I do 'enjoy' in those gps locations) ... and henceforth and but yet then since it is the discernance ... this means than then I'm automatically in the 'cult' of 'ifs therapists' and hence I should 'play chess (or even more trollable games?)' with 'cult leader' to not get to situation whereas I'm submitted into that cult further and further ... and supposedly 'more/less trollable games' are better than 'no games at all! (!!)' e.g. what I mean by that is that I should either play in my mind with either 'nadine lucas' and/or with 'akiva/keith wolff' (and/or with Osnat Arbel and/or with Einat Bronstein) in my mind ... (?)

[>] [PAPER_1] Varlakova excercise and longhand paper ... 
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Statistics on paper vs. 'statistics in the head' (aka. 'iterative probabilistic reasoning' (which is done 'over the days') will just not work without a 'recording' medium of some sort or you'll 'forget' what you 'thought' yestreday ...) (that's one example of 'wtf paper') ...

[>] [PAPER_1] Varlakova excercise and disposing of longhand paper ...
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ So how do I connect the 'disposing' of longhand paper to 'the only thing that I can discern as non-enjoyable' aka. { 'ifs therapists landscape ban' vs. 'sleep doctor final verdict incoherence' }
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ Longhand Paper disposal starts with computer organisedness (sysadmin and making order in filesystem ...) ...

[>] ^^ Maybe 'trembling' for that part (?) could help as a last resort? (?) (or/and 'keep trembling' whilst I'm bringing myself to that 'somewhere')

[>] ^^ I suspect that what brought me here is that I was recklessly thinking about knocking neighbors that they have '500,000,000$' in monero ...

[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ That is until they knock on your door and face you face-to-face (and start communicating in 'speech' or in 'written form')

[#] Misc Notes - Limits Problem

[>] This problem seems somehow important ... e.g. in a sense that when this problem 'escalates' to immense proportions -- it can 'drive you crazy' 

[>] Example of a limits problem: вот хотел закрыть окно на щелочку ... и типа начал долго 'раздумывать' а может еще немножко 'прикрыть'? ... а может еще немножко 'открыть'. ... а может все таки немножко прикрыть? ... а может всетаки теперь немножко приоткрыть? ... ==> И так можно до бесконечности -- если ты в каком-то там хреновом специфическом состоянии находишься ... to the extent that it can drive you to madness ...

[>] Severe limits problem is a sign of a [<script name='traumatized'>makeQuizElem2('dHJhdW1hdGl6ZWQ=','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] psyche ...

[>] Example: Another example of a limits problem: Choosing grocery at the store: this one I don't like ... this one I also don't like ... this one I also don't like ... and like cycling over seemingly identical products over some 'little thing' ... eventually sabotaging the whole grocery purchase and later feeling depressed because you couldn't buy and that was _so trivial_, _so trivial_! How could you not buy me this simple thing!?!?!

[#] Misc Notes - Grounding in books via podcasts & videos ...

[>] ^^ Sometimes I just can't f*cking _touch_ books e.g. cults books, even after watching hours on hours of podcasts -- which is some sort of a hidden indicator of some sort -- everything appears 'normal' on the surface ... but on the other hand I can watch podcasts for hours and still be unable to just touch a f*cking book!
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ So maybe this could be some sort of 'indicator' of how deep in twilight zone etc.. (unable to earn crypto don't know why etc.)

So what are some books that could help me 'palpate' where I am in the 'gloom' spectrum ==> so obviously cults books (e.g. find out where you stopped previously yesterday or a few days ago etc...) ... (?)

[@ ^ 1.] Fiction books -
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Sometimes I get a 'fog' of where I were with a fiction book ... ==> Just find where I am ...
[@ ^ 1.1.] Book: Leviathan wakes ... (both on flibusta and libgen,, goodreads finalist 2013). ==> tbd1,,

[@ ^ 2.] Bjj book - eventually I can't touch it because on the other hand the zygomatic photogenic face destruction was the, m, on the grade of 'ostrov' movie grade mistake -- that, like, an individual never, like never, gets forgiven for it. And the whole 'not giving up on martial arts entirely' problem (amidst sensing subtle 'power plays' (irregardless of whether I'm now photogenic or not) is NP-hard because of that 'ostrov' mistake ... so henceforth starting with some mild 'do not give up on martial arts entirely' type books and hoping that that one is 'chewable' so I don't 'self cut into little pieces' ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ As I've said, if you start with chin-na book it's also not good ... because if it's 'only in your head' then it kind of seems that you have yes given up on martial arts entirely if before practicing any 'moves' (even the barely resembling some functional moves) you say 'you did enough, enough enough -- don't touch don't touch don't touch' and eventually just read read read and don't practice sh*t ==> So here is probably is tai-chi book (where at least you 'dance out' some martial arts elements) is 'best bet' ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ Apparently with 'dancing out' 'martial moves' there's no 'don't touch don't touch don't touch' immediately firing before even starting ... but rather lets me finish the 'dance out' ... at least _something_ that is not _entirely in the head_ ... 
[@ ^ 2.1.] ^^ Still haven't figured this out yet ...

[@ ^ 3.] ...

[@ ^ 3.] Cults books
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Нету места мне в мире этом и по всему этому израилю миша меня опередил по всему израилю поверх и поперек. Не нахожу себе места в мире проклятом этом после того как сотворили надо мной что сотворили.
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Что бы Я не делал - как бы не извивлялся - мишин сын растет (и может еще там планируется ...) ... мщю ли Я -- помирился ли Я ... и не факт что у людей рождаются сыновья вообще -- после пяти дочерей итп ... 

[@ ^ 4.] Dating & Human-mating books (& grounding on them via mra documentaries and podcasts)
[@ ^ 4.1.] ^^ Иногда когда Я типа пребываю в состояниях что Я не вижу 'десяти-часовой стратегии вылеза' из состояния в котором Я сейчас нахожусь (типа один такой пример это когда в рестинг дей у тебя закрыт доступ к крипто-транзакзицям например (а так когда открыт доступ к таковым -- то вроде пока еще микро-апдейтс этого документа вместе там с сваппингом, ре-стейкингом, и говернанс-вотингом вроде пока 'держит' как 10-часовая стратегия вылеза из 'сумрачных состояний')) - то тогда в таких случаях может быть все-таки да прибегать и к таким мерам (по крайней мере это да работало 2022.11.06))
[@ ^ 4.1.1.] ^^ Рашионала она такая: (1) Что типа эирдроп хантинг - это хреновая, не-совсем-стабильная стратегия. (2) Индие-крипто лайфтайм нарратив - это более стабильная стратегия, но тут громадная пропасть которая 'всплывает' тогда -- что мне уже 44 почти и меня диким образом предала семья в том числе мой родной (!!) брат (!!) и так или иначе - половой орган есть и в нем так-же есть кровеносные сосуды. И так-или-иначе когда захочешь вернуться к 'более-стабильному программированию' (или учителю по программированию х/з) - то тогда так или иначе всплывает тема баб и позднего возраста.
[@ ^ 4.1.1.1.] ^^^ И поэтому - тогда чтобы заниматься тем-же самым 'нюхать' хоть как-то этот же самый 'более-стабильный' 'инди-крипто лайфтайм наррэйтиве' то нужно проходить через-эту-тему баб (что раскинь-или-прикинь несомненно травматично и несет с собой секондари эффектс само-по-себе).

[@ ^ 8.] Crypto technology books (tbd1)
[@ ^ 8.1.] ^^ Crypto that you don't talk about is a great 'psychological' and 'fragmented psyche' helper tool (think having a large 'bonding leverage' for 'lipton tea' -- does that affect 'psyche fragmentation' or not (in a sense of having a 'cohesive singular identity')?) ... so crypto technology books help in many ways for example how to store those money more safely ... in which blockchain? In which pow blockchain of all pow blockchains?   
[@ ^ 8.2.] ^^ In some days you can't do 'crypto transactions' ...
[@ ^ 8.3.] ^^ Bridge 3h punishment is a 'lesser bottomless pit' than more major cults out there but again a big bonding leverage can absolutely 'prolong' the '3h punishment' buffer ... in a sense that if '3h punishment is still not enough for you for self-accountability' then you could bond some secret sum of money if you have such sum ... and 'prolong that 3h punishment buffer' and thus come out as a yes 'accountable' person in society you reside in ...
[@ ^ 8.3.1.] ^^ Again without knowing the technology behind it ... crypto is a 'ghost city' for outside investors who just fomo into bitcoin and ethereum ... so you are with your current knowledge are alot like them compared to e.g. some smart contract and/or blockchain concensus dev who knows all concensus mechanisms and all smart contract langs and their 'buffer overflow' hack schemes that are more present in one smart contract language and less present in another ... it's like someone who doesn't do programming much won't know the need for typesafe programming and checking errors at compile time via more tighter contract programming versis less tight as c does it (it just says 'void*' parameter and idk what you pass to me therefore resulting in unforseen errors of 'programmer who forgot')
[@ ^ 8.5.] ^^ In a sense, 'indie-crypto lifetime narrative' elo is yes 'overwhelm' (of an 'unknown kind') whilst 'cryptocurrency elo rating' is not an overwhelm (?) ... and within 'cryptocurrency elo rating' ==> probably 'books' are bigger than ('>') 'farming' (e.g. are higher on 'elo rating') ...
[@ ^ 8.6.] ^^ Reason: Reading crypto technology books help with 'crypto [<script name='nosurf'>makeQuizElem2('bm9zdXJm','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] breach' aka the [<script name='r/nosurf'>makeQuizElem2('ci9ub3N1cmY=','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] hole that crypto [<script name='creates'>makeQuizElem2('Y3JlYXRlcw==','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] (additional lottery-chance 1000$ a year is not worth the r/nosurf hole breach).
[@ ^ 8.7.] ^^ Reason: Compared to 'crypto developer googler' - if you know sound fundamentals of many blockchains could have an edge, when you're amidst a 'coding war' and don't have much time for 'theory' just like knowledge of 'hennessy patterson' book could give an edge, hypothetically, compared to some non-knowledgeable integrity programmer (of the same 'photogenic rating') ... (just trying to come up with reasons here to battle madness of my life situation, sorry!)

[@ ^ 14.] CPTSD Books ('serial humilation')

[@ ^ 16.] DID books (is there a 'rock bottom'?) ...
[@ ^ 16.1.] ^^ Queued Videos for prewatch-grounding in books ==> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoI94Epkjrc,, 

[@ ^ 28.] Programming books are very powerful because the notion of 'the less code -- the more secure the money' -- you harvested from them (tha programming books) ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Whatever ... and how does that help me? That I should root in programming books? After watching programming documentaries? Memrise.com? Tm-srs? (?)

[#] Misc Notes - Distress Books - Finding Your Place Within Books amidst Mental Fog -- Keeping Track ('books fasting')

Preamble section (or whatever it's called ...):

[>] ^^ 'Statistics on paper' vs. 'statistics in the head' ...

[>] ^^ Track where you _stopped_ yesterday within a specific book and/or 'book category' ... or is there a 'fog'?
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Even if you didn't progress -- remember the place/context of where you picked up 

[>] ^^ When you can't discern between 'prison' and 'freedom' and even more so don't care about { 'ifs therapists ban' vs. 'euthanasia doctor's final verdict' } (aka 'when' 'death' is involved .. then I don't know definitely it has to be 'dry books' 'fasting' when 'death'/'looking too long into abyss' is involved ...

[>] ^^ The idea for this came from / when driving to shore border ... and the premise is such: if you could only 'find' your place in Jay Earley's IFS book (or his 'freedom from inner critic' book) and didn't progress with reading at all --> This doesn't necessarily mean, that 'you are faulty' it might just mean that 'some ifs concept that you've read about earlier, is still being internalized and after 2-3 weeks or months, you 'll be able to 'progress' a paragraph or two or more ... -- and you just need to keep checking, to not forget about ifs/cptsd/did/sokal-hoax/william-kingdon-clifford narrative) ... 
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ During periods of 'overwhelm' & 'burnout' at least do not forget about 'narratives' via 'books' maybe overwhelm sometimes will recede and then you could progress again ...

[>] ^^ I think what keeps me to 'books' is that 'leverage trading practice mode on http://gains.trade ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Т.е. как та девочка которую 'насилуют' в деревне ... она 'хихикает' ну типа все 'классно, типа! а че!' .. а потом приходит домой -- входит в 'gains.trade' и говорит -- 'о, such a leverage-trading cheerleading friends I have ...' ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ So in a sense she doesn't, m, (r/mengetrapedtoo ('<cough>, <cough>, ;)')) understand on a 'surface level' that she is being abused .. but when she comes home -- she sees the 'results' on 'leverage trading shorts & long position & total balance' screen ... 

[>] ^^ Since there's 'information overload overwhelm' section in this document,, and 'crypto bonding leverage' is important to me .... ==> Hence this makes rationale for 'books fasting mode' .... (?)

[@ ^ 1.] ^^ When you are abused by 'close family' (e.g. a davidx story about a girl who said it's ok to be raped by her father (men, by the way, get raped too)) or some 'big huge establishment' such as (government entity) -- what sometimes results is - not 'sadness' ... not 'depression' ... but rather 'D.I.D' ... and some people at academia have researched well how to operate within this phenomenon (which is even rejected by some part of society (possibly even intentionally, with an intent to gaslight and gain additional power))
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ So for us, reading 'ifs exam certification books' is something that we could more coherently talk with myself aloud when out and about (amidst aforementioned gaslighters, and lesserly be 'swept off our feet' by situational 'horrors' and 'disasters').
[@ ^ 2.] Poor you, ohh poor you ... you were looking for that 'rock-bottom' (cannot find myself where's the rock bottom) but the 'rock bottom' is within Nadine Lucas's Zoom Group (because of 'Evidence Flipping' 'Socially Proofed' knockos) ...

[@ ^ 1.] Go is missing 'human element' (which might be important, or might not) ... chess is 'contaminated' because father could be a 'rapist' (?) (?) (?) or could be not ... so now it leaves 'second-complex deep-strategy game with 'human element' (aka. king & checkmate) in it ...
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ But again, it is lacking in 'technological tools' e.g. gradual texel-like engine, puzzles website, ...
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ But on the third hand, when you've read that someone read 'dictionary' in prison isolator cell ... maybe having a book and 6-graudalities engine & google is still better than that one ...

[>] Chess Books (Use 'I lost/won him in chess so what ... but I still don't have 150 million $ in bitcoin/monero' excuse) ==> [2022.11.18 23:12]
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ If going to a chess teacher regularly (whatevers), then 'out of embarassment' -- to not be considered some 'dumdum' by him, you would be reading chess books and practicing.
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ You could choose baduk teacher, or xiangi teacher ... but most likely the scope/landscape of chess teachers that is most prevalent in israel - is chess teachers -- and if you think about winning somebody 5 times in a row ... then in practice for us, maybe chess and go and shogi and xiangqi are almost mostly the same thing, besides and in addition to the fact that 'chasing the most human complex game out there' is also given to various interpretations and 'jumping games' according to 'most recent' complexity research -- chess is still considered one of the strongest contenders for 'most complex ....'
[@ ^ 1.] If you win him in chess - use: 'I won a person in chess but that still doesn't change sh*t because I still don't have 150 million $ in bitcoin' excuse.
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ If you lose to him in chess - use: 'I lost in chess to a person but again this has still a very little relevance to his or mine bitcoin or monero balance (through either 'leverage trading' or 'being into bitcoin early' or 'luck' or whatever ...) ... excuse ... (to remove the 'overly emotional' component (or whatever (?) (?) (?))) (tbd1,,)
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ When you lose in chess to someone, ask how much bitcoin was lost by losing to him in chess? If the answer is 'negative' or 'zero' probably it's because 'trust gaining' and ''ganging up' with somebody' property of chess is more important or is longer lasting positive effect that outweighs the negative effect of 'pain of loss' that lasts usually for few days or weeks (compared to 'benefits' of actually playing chess or other 'lesser-trollable game' with someone (because it's lesser-trollable game it probably means that he has nowhere to 'escape' but 'confide' in you a little more (no, he's not 'trolling' ... hence he is trustworthy person (or something (I mean in regard to the 'why it's zero bitcoin lost' (or even a 'negative sum is lost') when 'lost in chess'))) ...

And what's the difference then?
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ Probably one answer is that in some books he presents a lot of use cases where he stretches the importance of extensive unit tests -- something that 5-12 year old kid would barely do. (And there are some other aspects that differentiate a '5-10 year old kid' from a 'trustowrthy smart contract dev' and though one of them - is software engineering methodologies books, and ability to pinpoint to a hirer-boss from which book you took this and that workflow/methodic).

[>] ^^ So in a sense, rhetorics aside, people level or sheople level -- whoever interferes in some 'metaphysical way' to my earning (or keeping) 150 million $ in bitcoin -- is either an abuser or a gaslighter or ill-intentioned person (and 'bitcoin 150 million $' can serve as a 'detector' of hostile entities, whilst in 'gloom'/'twilight zone' ...) because I'm not hurting nobody in this f******* neighborhood by wanting to earn 150 million $ in bitcoin -- that's a honest non-people-harming goal ... and whoever stands on the way (on the metaphysical level, where you don't know how to really 'fight' and who 'won' and/or who 'lost' ... and everything is 'gloomy' and 'twilight-ish') ... is apparently an ill-intentioned entity (regardless of whether it's a parent or some stranger neighbor) (e.g. why the f*ck does it bother you that I want to have 150 million $ in bitcoin?

[#] Misc Notes - Distress Books (a subsection of 'Grounding in books')

[>] Preamble: ^^ For completeness - please refer back to section 'grounding_in_books_tag_1,,'
[>] Preamble: Get to those books through appropriate videos but get to books in the end!
[>] Preamble: Q. What if I run out of books or movies on a cetain distress topic (e.g. women/mra)?
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ A1: I'm counting on endless stream of podcasts e.g. r/datingoverfifty themed and even from there I suppose you could harvest context for 'anti feminism legal self defense' in different shades and shapes.
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ Worst case re-read over-and-over (as if preparing to some 'eternal exam') via 1000 repetitions and spice it up with an endless stream of fiction books ...
[>>> 1.1.1.1.] ^^ In a sense, that, distress states are 1000x worse than 'ahh it's just sooo boring' states.

Q&A:
[>] Q. What are some examples of 'distress states'? (which I'm supposedly aiming to resolve via 'hmm,' 'distress books'?)
[>>> 1.1.] A1.1: Shame-induced self-harm polarisation (e.g. 'как ты смеешь показываться с таким лицом наружу вообще?') vs. 'coercion is 'felt' and is does require martial arts training' ..

[>] Q. How are ever books ever helpful with self-harm? ==> A1: Like with 'banano burn' on 'excessive content consumption' ...

Categories:

[>] ^ Cults Books ('beyond white worms' (when imagining that 'white worms' will eventually eat me below ground (a truism))

[>] ^ Women/MRA/LWMA/MenGetRapedToo books ('anti feminism legal self defense') books (living with powerful women in the same building)

[>] ^ CPTSD Books (as for building an excuse, at my fifties, for watching 20 yr/old PU lectures (then there's a f*cking abundance of them and not a shortage ...)) ==> It was f*cking childhood trauma wtf. (but on the flip-side I remain 'coherent') ...

[>] ^ DID Books

[>] ^ Crypto Technology books (sometimes 'crypto cryto voice just won't 'let go' ...)

[>] ^ Baduk book (find where you stopped yesterday (or 5 days ago (if was 'extreme' distress' ...)))

Not distress books (and why not):

[>] ^^ IFS Books - the point being - is if you just 'found' where you were yesterday .. and didn't really progress -- that doesn't mean that ifs stuff is not being internalized! This stuff takes (might take) long to digest ... 
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Sometimes a question pops up: 'Which one of ifs books?' ==> In distress states sometimes you have 'limits problem' so it's Jay Earley Ifs Therapy ==> No bad Parts (Schwartz) ==> Frank Anderson (his 'Therapists' book) ==> Second Edition IFS Therapy by Schwartz ==> All 3 tomes of earley ==> Do not change this, only over-the-days! 
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ IFS Book gives context to chess (via nadine lucas group) and making it 'lesser bottomless pit' in 'chess & katrain player's glasses' (but only if you have those 'glasses' (and you have those glasses by pure incidence from 'interacting' with 'nadine lucas group' ('why don't he ever talk?' / 'Is he spying on us'? && echoline && xyk))

[>] ^ [MINECRAFT_FOR_100_BTC_1] Indie-Minecraft Theory books (OpenGL, C++, etc.) (?) (you said: '100$ in BTC + minecraft' in the beginning of this document ...) ==> I'm kind of divided on whether it's a truly a 'distress book' as it brings ['overwhelm of unknown kind'] (after a few minutes of 'dwelling' on it) ==> So moved to ''after 6pm' distress books' section ... 

[>] Mantuba (dominic obrien) books (will cause fkn* overwhelms to boot)

[>] ^ Guitar and Piano books (need pc tweaking for that (?))

[>] [FICTION_BOOKS_1] Fiction books - if you 'feel bored' by author's verbal diarrhea - then write your own fiction novella ... or keep reading ... sometimes, in 'stuck' 'daytime' petah-tikva it's just so.

[>] Besides crypto-technology books .. probably also books that are related to 'distress coding around this very document' (some js/ts scripts that you wanted to write around this document, etc.)

Distress state transition (anomalies):

[>] Q. Sometimes I hear a voice 'tai-chi! tai-chi!' -- what do I do if I am in 'distress books' mode? How do I so-to-speak 'palpate' that 'ifs part' within that state? (Or should I just, m, 'let it yell and whateva!') ?
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ A1: Still, please remember that after 6PM till 4AM whether you've traveled to 'shore border' or you have not ... whether you've managed to not 'over-sleep' all that 6PM-4AM timespan (which happens sometimes too) ... that there's a slightly different 'distress books' mode for that time period which includes also (yeah, check below on that section, 'evening distress books',, tbd1)

[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ "I LOVE reframing these disorders as complex and even needed reactions to trauma, but I see a big problem in CPTSD communities ... I see a lot of black and white thinking, victim narrative, good vs bad, etc. [...] [torevise further, tbd1] [...] In the beginning, I thought CPTSD was the best diagnosis ever, because it stopped stigmatizing those with trauma and let the world know that it really wasn\u2019t our fault. But the longer I was stuck, the more I realized that the reason I loved it so much was it furthered reinforced the victim narrative in my head and that I was the \u201cgood guy\u201d while my abusers were \u201cbad guys.\u201d (I am not claiming anyone should forgive abusers. The healthiest thing imo would be to understand they are in the grey and view them with nuance, but still say they have no place in your life.) [...] This isn\u2019t fair, but it\u2019s the truth. It\u2019s why so many of us grapple with the abuse our parents places on us. Because we see that they were suffering, but that suffering does not negate toxicity. [...] I see a lot of people rejecting cluster b diagnoses and/or demonizing then. Those are OUR people. [...] It isn\u2019t fair, but if we want to heal we must take responsibility, accept who we are, and fight against this every day. It is not enough to reframe our experience with self love. We also must work on living with and loving others in healthy ways." [tbd1,,]

[>] Stephane/Dangeli ==> IFS is stephane, that has backup from academia ... this is important because sometimes it's 'shameful' to do stephane itself ... Jay Earley book has a note about 'opposite parts' [Chapter 5 ('becoming centered') ==> 'Other Ways To Unblend' ==> Finding an Opposed Part ==> (*1)]
[^ @ 1.] (*1) ^^ [Chapter 5 ('becoming centered') // 'Other Ways To Unblend' // Finding an Opposed Part ]  ==> """Look around inside for a part of you that is the opposite of the target part or a part that is in conflict with the target part. For example, Sheila might locate a part of her that wants harmony with her husband no matter what. [In addition to the part that is angry with her husband]. She would access that part and hear what it has to say. This would help her to realize that there is more to her than the Temper Tantrum Part. She would then find a place inside her that is neither the Temper Tantrum Part nor the Harmony Part. This is likely to be Self."""
[^ @ 1.1.] ^^ This is exactly the Stephane's 'complementary opposite tactic' that he describes right here!
[^ @ 2.] [ADMIT_TO_POLICE_1] IFS is an 'extension' of stephane - but when doing stephane - I want to admit to police everything, everything, everything! ==> So then there's 'memorisation' of ifs protector questions ... ==> Ha! ==> I need IFS therapist goddamit.

[>] 3 Most powerful ==> President of USA (Biden), President of Russia (Putin), President Of China (Xi Jinping)

[>] 3 Most richest ==> By their money balance (forbes? (?))

[>] 3 Most happily married ==> 3 Top hollywood actors (for now)
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Because they are most photogenic, --> happiness stems from there.

[>] 3 Most Physically fit ==> Google it.

Addendum: Proof that there are always boundaries between men:

[>] President Of Usa (most powerful by my own estimation) estimating 3 most powerful men on the planet: Putin, Xi Jinping, Rishi Sunak (was: Boris Johnson)
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Why not him himself -- because he can never know who planted what chip into his laptop (or wall (or ceiling (or shoe ...))) (or else he's an idiot).

[>] ^^ So how does that prove that there always boundaries between men?
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Because even at top level nobody really knows who's 'Number One' (#1). ... Putin thinks it's biden (or Xi Jinping (or Rishi Sunak)) ... And biden thinks it's putin (or Xi Jinping (or Rishi Sunak)))

Addendum: Notes, that should be moved/deleted from here as fast as possible (when possible) to avoid clog ...

[>] You are 'more able' to 'tremble' for 'stages of losing this document' because you have 'gains.trade' (aka. the 'metaphorical casino' right then and there (so it reminds you)) so henceforth forking gmx.io is a topmost and utmost priority which is both methodological and sysematic or you are gonna lose.

[>] Q. Why being a president is a sh*tty job?
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ A1: Jokes are being made of you constantly (depressing).
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ A1.2: It's more a 'service' than it's a 'life' because every single tiny mis-step of yours is harshly judged by media 'he smiled inappropriately' ... 'he made such and such inappropriate' 'woke' comment ... he insulted gays here and here ... '5 soilders dead in iraq' (while it was not specifically president's fault)
[@ ^ 2.1.] ^^ Most likely you are going to be in trial after your service as a president because most surely you have pissed a huge chunk of population by then (without even doing sh*t).
[@ ^ 3.] ^^ They might later, after your term, introduce the 'cutting' of the budged of allotted security personnel for past, former ex-presidents (wtf not?) and later you will have no protection from super-pissed people who you pissed during your presidency term whilst this wasn't even directly your fault (but some of your subordinates f*ckup) ... and now it's you who 'serve as a target' ...

[>] Q. Why, even though being a president is a sh*tty job - one should want to aspire to be a president?
[@ ^ 1.] A1: Because if he was that much schizophrenic (or simply very damaged in his brain), or 'black swan' enough, so, that only 'noting down top-of-the-mountain' on paper could snap him out of those horrid 'pinkness' states ... then obviously taking on being a president and eating criticism from everybody and his mother is a better option than staying schizophrenic without ability to 'climb out' and 'lost and confused to oblivion' ...
[@ ^ 1.1.] A1.2: ^^ Theoretically one could manage to be a 'very rich man' (aka. have president-grade luxury living accomodations) and yet both avoid 'public eye'/'public scurtiny' but again that's a matter of luck ('have best of both worlds') ...
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ A1.2.1.: In a sense, as a conclusion from the above notes, it's more of a 'run and hide' type of world ... more than it's 'what this world has to 'offer' to you' type-of-world ...

Preamble: 

[>] ^^ The idea is to, is, instead when critic overwhelms me with fatalistic overwhelming messages -- instead of saying 'пошел ты нахуй собака проклятая, заеб*л уже!' и начинать гасить его в стиле 'если еще раз скажешь - подзатыльник въебу' -- то типа вместо этого предложить ему написать в процентах это на бумажке ... и через год выкинуть такие бумаги (потому что клог) (но отдельный листочек и сохранять его куда-то в пакетик) (но если заметки то писать на другом листе) ...

[>] ^^ Potential origin: This has started when visiting kanevsky once, and then I started incanting 'my brain works for my own benefit ... my brain works for my own benefit ...' (but possibly done tai-chi kata beforehand ... (so this might be a 'cross-section' between tai-chi and what kanevsky tried to 'drill in' via his 'reverse psychology' coersiveness etc.)))

[#] Dtao - Frontal collision dtao (frontal collision with sanitars - dtao's) (but it's relation with parents ...)

[##] Preamble - WTF Dtao (and when dtao is not needed):

[>] Q. So when dtao are not needed and when dtao are yes needed? ==> ?
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Or rather is there a situation possible when dtao is not needed? ==> So far I don't forsee (200k$ in crypto (?)) 

[>] First of all 'wtf dtao?' is a weird question in a sense, that this whole 'wtf parts' existence syndrome is the whole reason I needed dtao in the first place! But let's say this: if I'm being gaslighted and unable to do anything about it (either the gaslighting is 'too subtle' that the police cannot be 'activated' or the gaslighting is from a family member whose death I am afraid of as well, beside his/her horrific gaslights) - then dtao, makes the 'subtle' gaslighter - doubt his own perceptions then ... (because he's pummeled with a 'rhytm' of a confronting reality, to his 'thought up' reality).

[>] ^^ Again, one problem that I forsee is 'dtao limits problem' in a sense of ('how much dtao is enough?' 'where does it stop?' 'I could write 'what bad/what good' on every little emotional trauma which would result in a burnout (to write those every day ...)'

[>] ^^ Sometimes the gaslighter gaslights me so, that I even can't write dtao for days in which case we need either 'secret texel-only chess teacher' or 'secret ifs therapist' (the earlier probably the better because I don't give him a reason to reject me and yet I get deeper social proof, than just, m, clerks at the store that nod me with their heads) ... ==> How do I get there? G-d knows.

[>] ^^ So far, theoretically, how much dtao I can survive? 10? 20? 100? ==> Work on testnets in parrallel to it. When you have 200k$ in 'secret crypto' there's a correlation - I wrote above.
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Again, maybe because, then a gaslighter could subtly 'smell' your 'lawyer hiring ability' ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Again, remember to plan the pomodoro steps, before actually doing them (this definitely seems more 'sterile' and 'less jerky') ...
[>>> 1.2.] ^^ Hope again that I could somehow figure out how do I come to a texel-only chess teacher. (?)

[>] Basically, the beginning of dtao is something like 'wgwaw/wbwaw' and 'w(hat)g(ood)j(enny)s(tay)/w(hat)b(ad)j(enny)g(one)' because this is a one sure polarisation that never gets resolved because you can't fully 100% control her brain (and it 'branches out' from there) ...

[##] Preamble - additional 'inner physics' in regard to dtao:

[>] [PAPER_VS_COMPUTER_1] Dtao that is on the paper - is a burnout -- because people will see and start doing 'witchery' but on the other hand, if, you're lost in filesystem on where to write dtao ... then probably it should be 'migrated' to paper again ...

[##] Preamble:

[>] Those are not like in the previous section, which are about: 'Overwhelming inner critic dtao' ... those ones are to do with 'father polarization' that I'm not able to resolve due in time (see that section also)

[>] So far hard cap: encoded dtao on paper negligified considering to 'second hospitalization' ...

[>] Either it's 'parents' abandonment & denouncement' ('бес вселился в голову') <or> it's with uprise of internet they got 1000x more powerful <or> it's my zygomatic/c.t. that disables me to discern what the f*ck is really going on ... (this def. seems crazy).

[##] Onwards 1.1:

[>] I'm in 'rape in prison enjoy' state ==> I don't even _object_ to some 'additional tests' that 'those people' in psych ward will do to me ... in fact - I'd rather _enjoy_ it ... ==> Guess is -- that trauma is so deep and the unblending work that is needed is so f*cking massive, that not sure that during lifetime, less to say during father constrained-time that he wishes for -- will I be able to unblend those ... ==> so this is like a lottery -- will they hospitalise? won't they hospitalise? -- it's really a 'lottery-grade' question ==> So now, when I'm thinking about describing that very situation to him, and asking him for further help, to give me more time for unblending self-work, to avoid the aforementioned hospitalisation ==> thinking of asking him for further help results in me getting vibes like 'это будет ошибка, идиот!' from my parts (that are probably blended in some clusterfuckiada, ==> parts don't realise though, that actually the hospitalisation (and not their 'это будет ошибка, идиот!' objection) is the one, that will fuck me up even thousand millions times more ==> , that after it - I'll get tens of thousands of more parts and complexities and complications ==> won't be able to get to my 8-9k$ after even 5-6 years (or will need 80-300k$ after 'second hospitalization') ==> So then again here question comes to: ==> so parts tell me 'это ошибка, идиот!' невзирая на предстоящую катастрофу ==> (tbd1,,) 
[@ ^ 1.] So, trying then this dtao:
[@ ^ 1.1.] Dtao:
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] What good is psychiatric hospitalization? ==> o-wgiph? (on paper)
[@ ^ 1.1.2.] What bad is psychiatric hospitalization? ==> o-wbiph? (on paper)

[>] ^^ Due to 'virulent & cautistic' cptsd critic that keeps acting 'pervasively' (no disrespect), thought of devising the following dtao: how bad is to 'talk to father about chess' in perspective of (amidst impending danger of) 'second psychiatric hospitalization' ... ==> so like:
[@ ^ 1.] Dtao: ('talking to father about chess') ('amidst impending danger of') ('second psychiatric hospitalization')
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^ o-wbttfac-aido-sph: ==> o-wbttfac-a(midst)v(erbal)t(hreat)-o(f)p(sychatric)h(ospitalization) 
[@ ^ 1.2.] ^ o-wgttfac-aido-sph: ==> o-wbttfac-a(midst)v(erbal)t(hreat)-o(f)p(sychatric)h(ospitalization)

[>] ^^ Due to need of 'daily dose of outside immersion' (otherwise it feels like I'm 'out of oxygen' if I stay all day inside ...) ... there's relevance again of 'wgwaw' because of 'vastness' of eye contact with local females that propels me and unable to keep my course & destination -- so ... ==> h(ow)i(mportant)i(s)w(oman)a(nd)f(amily)ctee ==> 'wgwaw'/'wbwaw' ==> 'wbr(epoductory)h(yper)r(epression) / wbi(s)m(edusa,)wi(tch,)m(anipulaltive,)e(xtorting,)o(r)e(motionally)a(busive)w(ife) ==> and 'wgli/wbli' too ...

[#] Misc Notes - Coding around this document - as a supposedly-distress activity 

Preamble:
[>] ^^ Sometimes perpetuals-trading still 'slips in' (and it happens f*cking impulsively! (e.g. yesterday 800$ with solana out-of-the-blue (and it was f*cking luck that I could get out of it ... it immediately went downslope immediately after)).

[>] ^^ Pay attention to 'distress books' as much as possible ...

[>] ^^ Off-shadow trading by 'coding' micro, but useless features around/for/about this document ... just for the sake of coding and steering off perpetuals leveraged trading. If I wrote some useless feature at least I 'killed time' and yet though not lost money like SBF (who leverage-traded FTT? (?))

[>] ^^ Remember that there's 'scripts/utils-staging.js' for in some states when you code, you sometimes get 'delayed' on some other 'perpetuals' screen when switching alt-tab ... 

[>] Leverage/derivatives trading or simply trading of any kind will definitely make 'programming in distress' impossible, because you will be compulsively switching to that trading screen, when switching alt-tab ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ And this document both relies on existence of $100 in bitcoin and also 'coding minecraft' (which was just made impossible, via leverage trading screen comulsive checking).

Warmups (considering its a distress):
[>] Making order in filesystem ...

[>] Reading js/ts books (because the coding is around this document, not 'reactos') ==> Not sure ... whether it will 'blow' or not ...

[>] Again, reminding here -- to read blockchain technology books. (?)

[>] Reminding: chess & baduk books ..

[>] Book: Shibashi book for, m, 'extremely noting' the 'shame-overdose-induced' 'self-harm'

[>] Getting back onto favoxil or at least ruminating about buying it (bridge just didn't 'fly' (for many reasons including 'Jay Wacker'))

[>] Throwing paper (and possibly into the water too) -- when you meet 'complex problems' (b/c 'programming puzzles' sometimes are more 'complex' then some menual, repetitive work such as 'do 5 repetitive swaps on 3 wallets') ==> You write them on paper ==> Sometimes personal stuff 'slips' in there too ... ==> So maybe would be useful to dispose of it from prying eyes.

[>] Book: Tai-chi book for 'not giving up entirely on martial arts narrative' ==> does it belong here or not?
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Like we said, with 'most-likely-corrupt-policemen-involved type of coercion' you could, m, easy talk about 'katrain' and then your 'maintaining same elo level with katrain goes: 'boom!' ...' ... ==> So there's obviously always is a rationale for 'not giving up entirely on martial arts narrative' (and there weren't for 'shame-overdose-induced self-harm' ....) ...

[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Что типа из далекого прошлого х/з помню что типа когда слишком сильно двигают диванами - это значит что меня ждет что-то на примере 'unexpected bad surprise' в плане того что что-то тривиальное такое да пролетит: или в субботу останусь без продуктов питания, или выеду наружу без заряженного телефона, без туалетной бумаги в сумке (которую туда вчера хотел положить еще), без заряженного велосипеда ... итп ... странная вещь ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ Будем честны с собой - 'странная' 'дименция' ... в таких-или иных дозах у меня все-таки наблюдается -- как не стыдно это признать!!! (A voice says that might be related to 'limits problem' ('starky out!'))

Reasons to avoid any 'confronting' thoughts against neighbors whatsoever (beyond considering them 'slightly exaggerated environmental noise' that nothing can be done about)

[>] If you're fighting on 'metaphysical level' (as opposed to chess/xiangqi/shogi) -- you are always, always going to lose (99.99999...9999999%)

[##] Why do they bother me? (posed as an 'open--abstract-thinking--question') (see though above reasons to avoid 'confronting thoughts')

[>] Sometimes with excessive knocking I'm saying my passwords (!!) aloud (!!) ... 
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ So then maybe michael bezzel book is more important then ever!

[>] Кто-то (и Я не хочу указывать конкретно пальцем) 'триангулируется' на мой 'диапазон мышления' и начинает 'потюкивать' (или содавать какой-то фоновой шум (типа окно хлопнуло вдруг со страшной силой или отркылось слишком резко итп.)) раз-в-пять-минут ... и как 'второстепенный' эффект после таких ритмичных 'постукиваний' вдруг у меня создается желание послать резко в 'r/cults' какой-то ответ от 'chatgpt' и собственно не подождать один день ... а сразу рывком неостановимым послать -- и ничего вообще то в этом страшного и нет -- но только вот бесконтроль мешает в состояниях когда нужен 'trauma grounding' ... 
[^ @ 1.] ^^ Просто найти какое-то место максимально рядом с домом где нету с прохожими 'eye contact innuendos with random bypassers' и также там естественно и отсутствуют те-же вышеупомянутые (на которых конкретных челов Я не хочу указывать пальцем) постукивания по природе вещей (ну если нету конечно дрона (a flying drone) надо мной) ... и подышать глубоко пять-десять раз.

[>] I'm about to note something down -- then I hear a few 'drags' -- and then boooom -- forgot (what I wanted to write).

Trying to stay indifferent:

[>] Frame them as 'environmental noise' (and 'seeing' beyond that -- is just looking into the abyss (just like it is with 50-to-80 years old 'old age' suicide reframe went ...)) ...
[@ ^ 1.] ^ That suicide reframe went like this: Old Age ==> So you'll live a shorter life, let's say 50 instead of median 80 ... not thinking about 'longer but more sh*tty life' (because that's 'looking into the abyss') ...
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^ Same is with knocking neighbors ... 

[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Remember they have infinite monero balance and they are checking their stiffledness every 5 minutes.

[>] So let's say they are checking their stiffledness every five minutes ... but you need to be either super-ultra rich to do that (so probably they have 'tons of money in monero')
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Maybe that way by assuming that no one knows how much money the other one got in monero, I could maintain a somewhat survivable boundary with them? (?)

[>] Представь что человек (какой-то душевный инвалид или пенсионер) сидит на стуле 24 часа у себя в квартире (или это женщина-инвалидка или пенсионер) и у него 'нервозный рефлекс такой' что он тихо сидит и вообще типа замкнутый такой почти ни с кем не разговаривает но раз в 1-2 минуты он просто обязан подвинуть стул на котором он сидит. Типа злиться на нервозные порывы такие или на людей которые вот в таком состоянии находятся -- бессмысленно. Типа че ты на него срывайся не срывайся он всеравно будет двигать стулом своим раз в 5 минут. Хоть ты его дубинкой поколоти. Всеравно он пока не умрет - будет продолжать раз в 5 минут двигать свой сидетельный стул. Побьешь его дубинкой -- он впадет в обморок -- очнется --- и всеравно через пять минут начнет опять двигать стул. И сага продолжается (?)

[>] [RAMAT_GAN_BNEY_BRAK_BOUNDARY_IF_1] Knocking neighbors do not drive with me to { 'bney-brak' <--> 'ramat-gan-boundary' } every day (so in that sense they are not the only culprit (in a sense of 'corrupt-police-involved-here' coercion.))

[>] [ABOVE_FIVE_SENSES_1] It is possible that some coercion that I'm feeling is beyond auditory/visual/olfactory/kinesthetic (not included here 'taste') - senses ... e.g. not 'knocks' nor anything I 'see' either ... it's just some sort of a 'gut feeling' but beyond auditory/visual/olfactory/kinesthetic senses ... that yes does 'coerce me' but not through something that I can see/hear/smell/sense-via-a-touch (I mean we're going off-grids here but, the point that I'm making is that sometimes when I'm getting mad at knockos -- I definitely had moments and 'ifs parts' saying to me -- that I did wrong by doing so (by reacting angrily onto them (in a sense that, m, if someone yells 'goat! goat!' and you 'react angrily to him' then you might not see the real goat later.)))

[>] [YOU_ARE_GONNA_LOSE_1] If you're fighting on a 'metaphysical level' most likely you are going to lose. Because the battle is not 'well-defined'. Where is loss? Where is a 'win'? ==> Sooo ==> you're gonna lose 99.999% (e.g. some example would be probably: 'interstellar shove into the abyss scene' (?) (I'm just speculating here, sorry...)).

[>] [TRAIN_TO_BUZAN_1] Knocking neighbors are 'psychotic women' (like in 'train to buzan' movie) ==> Yelling at them is like 'evil begets evil' ==> What would happen if he'd yell at that woman in 'train to buzan'? ==> That would just make her more furious ...

[##] Some 'ramat aviv lucky imigrant''s obsever-style notes on their motivations ...

[>] Knocking neighbors - they gaslight. They check their 'stiffledness' every 5 minutes (every tiny so-called 'vibration' can be sensed) and then they 'gaslight' the surrounding environment (by making a random loud, unpredictable sound) 
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Question is - where they get the social proof to keep gaslighting so it's either from some place, or their relations with the hood' homies' and all my homies were left in mytishi so I'm out of ammo.
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ Q. What are their motivations? ==> Some corrupt cop wants an appartment nearby him for his son. 

[>] 'Freedom fighters' ... they check their stiffledness every five minutes or so ... and then, wtf, do they 'break out of their comfort zone'  (so hence the name 'freedom fighters' ...) ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ How they break out of their 'comfort zone'? Via doing randomised noises thus gaslighting the whole surrounding environment. (?) (What tyler called 'unstiffling' is more like 'gaslighting' ... seems to me)

[@ ^ 1.] Faucets (with prelude-leading to 'incentivized testnets') ==> A very potent shame factor amortizer,, but, ==> not possible at weekends, a rabbithole of its own (airdrop farming is like f*cking gambling)
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ But if you _just_ _have_ a somewhat substantial sum of funds, e.g. 8k-9k$ funds, they somewhat help you even during resting days if you don't touch them ...

[#] Misc Notes - ELO Ratings besides katrain/mom/civ/tetris-attack

[>] ^^ So, if we're talking about 'maintaining existing elo levels' - then are there 'elo levels' of: Foreign & Spoken languages knowledge? Of Guitar & Piano knowledge/skill? Of Drawing? Of Tai-chi? Of Programming? Rpg story/journey games? ==> Moved to separate section ...
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ If something goes wrong (it did happen once - with 'ifs elo') -- go back / retract to 'maintaining the same elo level with katrain' - it still works ...
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Drawing - probably not (as there is very little 'competition context') ...
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ We need/want that for 'bjj & chin-na' spindown as seemingly just katrain/mom/civ/tetris-attack just don't seem to 'cut' it on their own alone-wise ...
[@ ^ 3.] ^^ It seems that tai-chi (aka. 'martial arts meditation' (as opposed to yoga, which is a 'postures' meditation)) is a 'part of' maintaining same elo level with 'bjj&chin-na'? E.g. 'do at least some 'farthest resemblance' movement? (?) (?) (?)
[@ ^ 3.1.] ^^ Or maybe I'm wrong? (?) (?) (?)
[@ ^ 3.1.1.] ^^ There's no 'maintaining the same elo level with tai-chi kata' because tai-chi is the actually one from which the whole idea of 'keeping _at least_ the same elo level with katrain' hyper-focus came from ... in a sense that it says ... 'at least don't lose martial arts at all if you have bjj painful fracture ... because martial arts are _so_, _so_ important' and 'probably self-rehearsed 'mostly theoretical only' chin-na is better than no chin-na knowledge altogether, even theoretical' from that 'at least don't lose martial arts entirely' probably came the understanding: 'don't lose katrain entirely' ... ==> so supposedly copy-catting chin-na as per jwing ming's books & dvd's (you have both, also for martial applications of it) supposed to 'keep' that 'elo' 'hyper-focus' ==> So I suppose what it should be is: 'copy-catting chin-na and it's martial applications as perfectly as possible' and the best you can make of it ==> Try 'trembling' for it ... who knows ... ==> tbd1,,
[@ ^ 4.] [IFS_1] ^^ Is there 'maintaining the same ELO' with ifs? ==> Seems like not so it means that ifs is a 'bottomless pit' yet in some certain situational overwhelm situations it is very useful... and there are a lot of overwhelming situational situations in certain specific GPS locations ... ==> tbd1,,
[@ ^ 4.1.] ^^ Also: ifs is not a bottomless pit in a sense that if a specific individual is in some cult (or jumping between cults) ... then ifs provides an 'academically-refined' cult which is a 'less' 'bottomless pit' than some other 'cults' that exist out there ... due to 'academia-peer-review' property of it ...,, but still tbd1
[@ ^ 4.1.1.] ^^ So in a sense ifs is not a 'bottomless pit' but rather is a 'lesser' 'bottomless pit' which is good for segments of population who reside in a 'bottomless pit' (e.g. cults followers who do not realise and/or blackout within them, the harmful effects of their cults)...
[@ ^ 6.] ^^ Is there 'elo level' regarding 'digital minimalism' and 'extreme privacy' (a.k.a. michael bezzel? (?)) ==> Apparently can't touch that because moving to ramat aviv is on a 'higher note' than 'worrying about extreme privacy' because if I'm not 'careful' then the whole shebang of being near 'internet' & 'privacy' could be 'taken away' from me ... so it's secondary unfortunately (and things will inevitably 'spill' the painful ones which shouldn't ...)
[@ ^ 6.1.]
[@ ^ 7.] ^^ Just curious - is there 'elo level' with bridge? ==> Well yep if you sit 3h bridge marathon with Oren Lidor and/or Doron Yadlin -- you will either score less or score more or equal -- and that determines your elo level compared to them ... 
[@ ^ 7.1.] ^^ This elo level is rather 'sparse' compared to chess e.g. statistical-rather but in overall sense if you run 10-days marathon against one of them ... then their { (1) Memorisation of bidding language. (2) Knowledge to recognise of signals when playing hand. (3) A little bit of algorighmic thinking of how to play and what not to play depending on what partners played (but this algorithmic thinking is much less 'deep' than chess) (4) ? } ==> will to a large extent determine whether they win or a lose in points in that 10 days marathon. But then again, this is not a 'measure' of anything ... e.g. their algorithmic thinking might be more 'mediocre' than a chess player ... their 'language of bidding' knowledge -- might be due to them having inherited that from their rich parents from childhood ... just like french was a language of 'high circles' in some non-french societies ... but again the purpose of this is mostly about not the 'elo' but rather having some sort of alternate venue of connecting with people / making connections with people ... but then again ... this is not the sole way of making connections ... and it's possible that existence of interconnected internet has made this 'bridge' lucrativity even more obsolete ... as one could simply invest in making an arbitrage bot and blow all the bridge people out of the water ... I mean in a sense that 'bridge' was some sort of 'gamble-pointing of a finger' when you were out of options ... and so you saw e.g. some ad in tel-aviv university sports club and thought: ha! this must be it! ... but it is very possible that for example working with parts and interrogating them with protector questions ... in retrospect ... wouldn't bring you to any 'bridge' seeking altogether. E.g. in a sense of: nothing's broke -- don't apply any sort of 'band-aid' on top of it ... it's like more like carrying some notion of 'if it's all so seemingly 'too calm'' then 'add even more overwhelm on top of it' -- 'and then it all will become clear!' sort of mindset .. which might in retrospect not overwhelm -- the already overwhelmed & mega-traumatised system.
[@ ^ 7.1.1.] ^^ When nobody talks ... there's not to 'bring yourself to people' to cause additional overwhelm on the system, that might in fact, be traumatised and needed more of that ramat aviv immersion ...
[@ ^ 7.1.1.1.] ^^ Probably even 4.30 wouldn't exist and many things wouldn't exist should I have known about 'nonsense lana physicist' much earlier on.
[@ ^ 7.1.1.1.1.] ^^  William Kingdon Clifford: "'It is wrong, always, everywhere and for any one, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence.'"
[@ ^ 8.] ^^ Is there 'cryptocurrency elo rating'? (aka. 'elo rating pertaining to cryptocurrency')
[@ ^ 8.1.] ^^ Blockchain & Crypto Technology books are probably '>' (bigger) in that domain-or-realm, than 'airdrop farming' ... (considering that plain 'indie-crypto lifetime narrative' is 'overwhelm' ...) 
[@ ^ 8.1.1.] ^^ In a sense that 'dry studying' of that technology somehow helps more than just plain farming/sybilling (although counter-intuitive (wtf does studying even help?!?!? (?)))) ...
[@ ^ 8.2.] ^^ Reading a substantial chunk of crypto-technology-or-blockchain-technology [<script name='book'>makeQuizElem2('Ym9vaw==','&lt;pomflh&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] before doing any faucets and/or airdrops? (?) (in a sense of 'which is higher elo level?' - wise)) -- you have staking already ... so ... 
[@ ^ 8.2.1.] ^^ What I'm trying to get to - is to do only minimalist super-obvious airdrop farming ... and like 2-3 precalculated steps (didn't need to jerky-signup for neither ampleforth, nor optimism, nor stargaze, nor evmos, nor aptos, nor paraswap, nor cowswap, etc.) ... jerky-signups definitely f*cks me up. And a 'book' before faucets could get me into an appropriate mood before jumping onto twitter? (?)
[@ ^ 9.] [WOMEN_1] ^^ Is there such a thing as a 'dating elo rating' (as in r/datingoverfifty)? Or lack-of-dating-thereof elo-rating? In a sense that, m, it could be probably related to why ''indie-crypto lifetime narrative' elo rating' is an overwhelm, compared to 'cryptocurrency elo rating' ... ? (?) (?) (?)
[@ ^ 9.1.] ^^ Maybe it's just 'living around women' elo (without involving any sort of 'dating' or 'datingoverfifty' or 'lack-of-dating',, yet ...)
[@ ^ 9.2.] ^^ The horrid reality that ~ 30% of people don't know -- is that residental buildings (everywhere?) are dominated by women ... and by reading MRA materials you achieve two things: (1) To gather context and see also the ugly side of women unlike your reproductory organ wants to 'idealise',, and (2) Hopefully understanding of an importance of why tho f*** you should leave residential buildings from time to time (they are not really 'safety heaven') -- one of this techniques, by the way which you learned from Owen Cook about that dirty unstiffling sh*t that women do all the time. That context you got from mra/redpill. Was it helpful or harmful instead? ==> G-d knows. ... but in a sense ... it somewhat resembles the 'seeing through the matrix' analogy-or-metaphor (in a very dark and unhealthy sense, though). So jury is out on that one ... but anyway - the knocks are persistent, and are definitely an annoyance at times (bpd/did women? (?))
[@ ^ 9.2.1.] ^^ Point being: mra/redpill does help with some survival tricks where no one will explain. But only whisper. It got you f*cked, for sure, but then it also got -- internet is a double-edged sword ... point being is that ... sometimes in super-stuck states when I feel that I am what-ifs-cornered and crawling on ceilings for hours -- watching that context -- provides relief and nothing else is known to me which provides relief in those particular what-ifs-cornered-type-of-situations. Maybe I'll find it someday - but for now it's that.
[@ ^ 9.2.1.1.] ^^ To be able to find/spot/act-upon 'weaknesses' in seemningly flawless americanized female lawyers / female judges ... (for the aim of 'legal-self-defense') (is such thing even ever possible?) (?)
[@ ^ 9.2.1.1.1.] ^^ Get to books don't just stop at documentaries (that is a generic higher elo from experience in other parallel domains)
[@ ^ 10.] ^^ Is there ''indie-crypto lifetime narrative' elo rating' (aka. 'elo rating' pertaining to 'indie-crypto narrative') 
[@ ^ 10.1.] ^^ That is seemingly unfortunately is 'overwhelm' of some 'unknown kind' (when you had 8-9k$ - this was not an overwhelm) so unfortunately go back to 'cryptocurency elo rating' and dwell there? (?)

[#] Misc Notes - IFS ELO elaborations (if there's ever such thing like 'ifs-interrelated elo-rating')

[>] The 'schnitzel' aspect ...
[@ ^ 1.] Whilst visualising -- it's difficult to be a 'vegeterian bjj fighter' even if I plan to come there once in 5-10 years ... just eat a tiny fokking piece of schnitzel.

[>] [OUTSIDE\_1] [FREE_TO_YELL_ZONE_1] The 'free-to-yell' zone/place (after 6PM or sometimes even before) - aspect
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Even if I'm doing tai-chi at home -- supposedly want to get outside in the evening - and try to perform it outside for the second time ... because the demonic emotions sometimes are still stuck and want to be 'yelled out' when I can 'safely' 'yell them out' (there are not many such places in gush dan, unfortunately -- and are getting less and less so).

[>] [CHESS_1] The 'Chess' aspect ... ==> Q. Wtf is chess important not to omit when dealing with 'not giving up entirely on martial arts'?
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ With e.g. bjj -- you're still suspectible to 'cult mind control'.
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ Competition, and/or 'sensing boundaries' with other 'competitive men' almost throws 'dementia' 'out of the window' (but this doesn't come for 'free' -- it's with enormously demonic emotions though). 
[@ ^ 2.1.] ^^ But what the f*ck dementia has to do with 'martial arts entirely narrative' ==> 'Achievement' && 'Forgetfulness' is rather a dangerous combustion.

[>] Not getting 'provocated' by knocking neighbors at any cost. Imagination. Wildly. 

Additional factors:

[>] The 'this guy is too old and he's trying' shame ('haha!') factor ... ==> Probably for me the coercive abuse or whatever that is - just doesn't stop with age -- just shtaktel ya shmaktel. ==> So kind of redirect it into 'ahh, I want 150 million $ bitcoin (the form of money that is not dependent on some specific person giving it to me) -- not shameful at any age'

[#] Misc Notes - Shore Border, prison and freedom narrative 

[>] Basically, the idea of visiting ramat aviv every 72 hours, is because (1) If I delay it for 'too long' then traveling there - even after 48+ hours of staying there nearby (or near) (or adjacent to) the seashore -- I still won't be able to find a difference between prison and freedom (*1) ... and will fall asleep uncontrollably (*2) ... and then I will be forcefully taken! (which is unwanted? (?) (<-- haha! lol! ... --> see (*3),(*4) --> lol! lololololololololol!) 
[@ ^ 1.] (*1) ^^ (similar things happened where I couldn't, bluntly in-your-face watching the sea and standing literally near it at night, snap out of, the thought that 'prison is better than freedom' into 'freedom is better then prison') ==> ... so how come this then couldn't come to 'being unable to dissect even after just f*cking 48+ hours staying there' (if I delayed 'myself' in petah-tikva for 'too long'?)) ???
[@ ^ 2.] (*2) (like also happened in yaar bon (I just said f*ck it - I'm laying down wtf ja! ja! - aaand so I did ... and woke up at ~ 7 pm (luckily no one noticed a near-homeless person lying on the ground ...))
[@ ^ 3.] (*3) (and then though, it might require some bueracracy to get out they might 'test' me there for half a year ... one thing is when I myself get 'напасти' and going and trying to snap out ... the other thing entirely is when other people are directly involved and are 'supervising' my 'snapping out' process,) ... (tbd1,,)
[@ ^ 4.] (*4) also I just 'vaguely' remember that no matter what you think _now_ under mild tobacco influence & possibly some other lsd-like toxins that they 'secretly' 'shoved' there,, but after you resided in the same room with 4 foreign people the 'serial humiliation' dynamic (like in handesaim with 'roi') slowly started to 'sneak in' and you wanted out of there like 'off the hot stove' ... so again ... it might be possible that some lsd-like substances in Pall Mall Blue are doing that to me (this 'unable to discern between 'prison' and 'freedom' states) ...

Let's say that all day long (or for few days in a row) you were tirelessly ruminating on maintaing 'prison vs. freedom' elo rating ... and then by some miracle you ended up on some bycicle in, say, ramat-gan, and suddenly felt that you could 'discern' between 'prison and freedom' (as if it was a 'second nature to you') ... should you then turn back and go back home? ==>
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ A1: From one past date (a few months or a few years ago) when you were on the seashore -- looked at horison, and still could not discern between prison and freedom (as if it was your 'second nature') ... -- so theoretically it could be possible that one day, whilst looking at the seashore for 5 days in a row without leaving the seashore - you wouldn't be able even after 5 days to discern between 'prison' and 'freedom' ... so just as a matter of precaution ... maybe you'd want, if some battery is left - to travel all the way to the seashore as if it was some sort of 'hunger' that needed to be 'satisfied' ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ A1.1.: From some other past date (a few months or a few years ago) -- you were in some park and you laid on the ground, and you fell asleep (ah, just like that) and when you woke up -- it was nearly morning and you were lucky that nobody was still around (walking his/her dog or whatever etc etc etc.) ... so theoretically you could fall asleep and wake up either vandalised or in some police station.

[@ ^ 1.] She clearly called me via phone into this petah-tikva apparment, and told me on the phone. 'Ani mitstaeret. Ani mekava she timtsa avoda maher.' (give-or-take) ...
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ So what's the conclusion? What is it trying to say to me?

[>] [TRAILHEAD_1] [BROKEBACK_MOUNTAIN_1] Voice: 'brokeback mountain'
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ One important thing to remember, though, is that there's no more ... e.g. there's only 'parents denouncement' and 'parents abandonment' and parents turned into 'sharks' that will sue you at any opportunity (or he, specifically has (but she also told you once on the phone 'Вова, Я не хочу в тюрьму.' -- tbd1,,))
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ But specifically in a more 'immediate sense' - do send him this program, so he couldn't say as per that 'parents vacate from appartment' (r/legaladvice or r/narcissisticparents subreddit post) that 'he is a lazy bum' in his photogenic-madman self-conspired-fanatasy ...
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ A 'photogenic-madman' is a half-joke half-irony here because to non-luckies, and non-photogenics -- photogenic people do seem a 'madmen' ... because they can easily identify with freely-downloadable hollywood/bollywood flicks and that's a huge power (and there's even 'beauty sells' proverb to back it).

[>] [TRAILHEAD_1] Trailhead: Photogenic face (or lack thereof) is beyond 'ice cream tendencies' (as in a movie: Flipped (2010)) ...
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Whom do I sue? Do I sue gracies? For the bad marketing? Of bjj as a 'sports'? On the other hand tai-chi needs 'verification' (ha!) and without tai-chi I'm unable to embody.
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ So then for now, not 'everyday dtao' but once-dtao (is that zygomatic is [7%] (tbd1,,)) and yet as in every person, he is born with some limited revival capacities ... and there's still some % left ... and 'no bad parts' ... (but yeah, it's possible that I'll start fainting etc.)

[#] Misc Notes - Situational Portals for re-entry ...

Preamble: 
[>] Every f*cking single day they do this to me - this sc*m sh*t neighbors ...

[>] CPTSD Book: "If I am a bit repetitive at times about issues like 'shrinking the critic' and 'grieving the losses of childhood', it is my attempt to find different ways to emphasize the great importance of engaging these themes of recovery work over and over again. If you find yourself lost and not sure of how to get back onto the map, these themes will always be key portals for reentry."

Not resting day (cryptocurrency transactions are allowed):

[>] Trying to get back to making Gmx.io/gains.trade 'practice mode' fork via re-reading that book 3 times 
[^ @ 1.] ^^ Even without coding anything - this reduces 'steepness' ...

[>] [PAPER_DECLOGGING_1] It's either 'paper clog' unclogging -- or -- this document ...
[@ ^ 1.] ^ E.g. ever-accumulating 'paper clog' might prevent you from touching computer (including 'this document'). Imagine disaster scenario in which you want to break the computer hence unable to touch it ... yet the paper clog has meanwhile accumulated for years to come ...
[@ ^ 2.] Old, toremove: 'Tremble' for 'paper clog' (paper is needed because sometimes computer is overwhelming, or broken)
[@ ^ 3.] There are 3 things with paper (1) Throwing old 'todisp_1' paper, (2) Venting traumas to the river, (3) Digitizing checkmark notes (the most difficult part). 

[>] [PAPER_BUT_WITHOUT_DECLOGGING_1] Longhand paper sometimes serves as 'portal of entry' (regardless of whether paper is being 'declogged' or 'spied on' (aka for example when I'm in 'super distress' states)) and sometimes I simply ask myself to write 'print 5+5' on paper which seems, hmm, rather odd ...
[>>> 1.] So basically you're writing on paper your thoughts, and then there's a voice: 'write 'print 5+5'' ... so what do I do then? And does it really matter?
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ Again, in a sense, it looks like the right direction here is to get tho fock out of the house due to 'r/MenGetRapedToo' dynamic that is definitely manifesting here ...
[>>> 1.1.1.1.] ^^ But let's say that you can't get outside due to some unforseen circumstance (something in the house needs to be fixed urgently or you're waiting urgently for someone, or there's some unforseen other circumstance e.g. you were in distress ... so you started writing your thougths on paper ... then a thought 'write me 'print 5+5' came', but when now you think about getting out -- the distress aren't 'gone' ... you're still in 'write thoughts on paper mode' and 'stuckness' whom you're trying to write onto paper - says: nope, not getting out!' ... -- so what do you do then? (In a sense of a 'print 5+5' thought?)
[>>> 1.1.1.1.] ^^ Because such situations did occur more than once to me.
[>>> 1.1.1.1.1.] ^^ So how do I 'continue' on that 'print 5+5' narrative? Let's say after few 'print 5+5''s in python repl prompt, you would next would want to probably write homebrew/weekend projects 'whatever you feel like' because 'disruptive technologies' and 'people are slowly 'catching up'' (aka. 'I'm having a fridge but everyone else have to go to the store and buy ice cubes' analogy)
[>>> 1.1.1.1.1.1.] ^^ So there's 'Misc Notes - What comes after 'print 5+5' section that follows on that 'disruptive technologies' 'people are slowly catching up' narrative (in a sense that if you don't do this, then ?)
[>>> 1.1.1.1.1.1.1.] ^^ Since you consider 'longhand paper' as a 'last-resort' 'portal of entry' into this document, and sometimes, a voice in your head ask you to write 'print 5+5' statement on that very same paper, which makes you 'stumble in confusion' and unable to 'continue' / to 'flow' / to 'move forward' with that particular 'portal of entry' ==> Henceforth 'meddling' with 'disruptive technologies && people are slowly catching up' narrative is a henceforth is in itself is a yes is a separate 'portal of entry' (because otherwise you'd write 'print 5+5' on longhand paper and not know how to 'continue' and hence 'longhand paper' 'portal of entry' is 'fucked' without { 'disruptive technologies' && 'people are slowly catching up' } 'portal of entry' ...

[>] [WHATS_THE_NEXT_STEP_AFTER_5_PLUS_5_1] Ruminating on 'what's the next step' after writing 'print 5+5' in python repl a few times ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Trying to be short & concise & save on words: Paper is yes a 'portal of entry' ==> 'Print 5+5' on paper voice - brings to stumblessness (wtf nonsense writing print 5+5 on longhand paper wtf) ==> Stumbles the whole 'longhand paper' 'portal of entry' 'route' ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ Important to mention here the { 'disruptive technologies' && 'people are slowly catching up' } narrative aka sometimes I get some 'miniscule' ideas about improving writing new scripts and little apps and mods that could potentially work in that domain ...
[>>> 1.1.1.1.] ^^ In at other times -- those 'little ideas' seem 'nonsense' and 'unimportant' ... so a balance has to be striken here (?)
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ Activities that might make the curve 'less steep' are obviously:
[@ ^ 2.1.] 'reading books' (langugage nuances, framework-or-technology nuances,, ?) 
[@ ^ 2.2.] 'step-through debugging and commenting 'the hell out of' minecraft code' (or a code of a project that performs almost similar function),
[@ ^ 2.3.] 'going through starter tutorials' on relevant topic,,
[@ ^ 2.3.1.] ^^ and implementing their code and 'playing around with it' by tweaking things here and there,,
[@ ^ 2.4.] Setting up sandboxed environments because restarts sometimes are a no-go ...,,
[@ ^ 2.4.] ^ Organising online materials into printable pdf's (sometimes there is just no books but very elarborate turorial)
[@ ^ 2.4.1.] ^^ So I could calmly read it as a book (in sw you don't need the materials to be academically-backed because it's experiental/experimental studying&hacking ,, tbd1)
[@ ^ 2.4.1.1.] ^^ Also google is 'mutable' and 'websites with prescious materials sometimes disappear' which is unhealthy paranoia but those are my personal projects and I'm not debating the importance of having 'coca cola secret formula' with anyone in a sense that 'setting boundaries' && 'gavin wood leverage' rule (if it is beyond setting boundaries) 
[@ ^ 2.4.1.1.1.] ^^ and in this case, in the case of 'portals of entry' the 'boundaries' are 'keep everything offline' and shoot anyone on-sight who debates that.

[>] Awareness that you are in a 'lesser embodiment zone' (and there are, 'better embodiment zones', somewhere nearby in which, entry, as in 'portals of entry' are much more straightforward/easier/less-resource-consuming ...)
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Currently I'm dealing with 3-4 problems: (1) Lesser/better embodiment zone,, (2) Father/mother/tyot-ira/psychiatry vandalism,, (3) 'Smoking fetish' (a medical disease that sometimes glides into perversive context),, (4) Old age ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ I once said whilst being in ramat aviv, that, m, staying in petah-tikva till-the-very-end -- is 'less metal plates' (both in 'teeth' and in the 'heart') than intentionally moving to ramat aviv gush agadol jascha heifetz to live there ...

[@ ^ 1.] ^^ And if it seems 'different' then most likely 'r/MenGetRapedToo' narrative is present ... (read books on that topic? (?) ('female power' and 'cults' books? (?))) (?)
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ But never forget though, that neighbors are just 'slightly exaggerated environmental noise' (which is sometimes very hard to treat them that way, but history shows that interfering with them doesn't favor us, although again ... sometimes I can't expect myself to be fully rational when in cptsd-retraumatised state, 100% at all times ... so whatever...) ...
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ Programming for money to escape from them is unfortunately still tedious whilst under them ('all your bases are belong to us'), but, who knows maybe that might propel you into 'spotting something in some smart contract' and return them back when you have '150 million $ in bitcoin' ...
[@ ^ 1.1.1.1.] ^^ The only 'rock bottom' you will ever find ... is with ifs zoom groups and ifs therapists under 'evidence-flipping socially-proofed' knockos ... (tbd1,,)  ... but again even there there is 'ban' (although highly unlikely (?))
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ ''Better embodiment' zone' is somehow connected/related ... (definitely, 99% 'better (or lesser) embodiment zone' is not about 'one, particular specific person')

[>>> 1.1.] ^^ And then to 'elo rating' && 'distress books' && 'r/MenGetRapedToo books' && ', hopefully connecting it to { 'one-cent-a-year-vs.-zero-cents-a-year' narrative && elo-rating } via either Dave Ramsey's books, or via 'Digital minimalism books' ... this is because it's actually not the 'AI chatbot' that helps me with 'madness' but more like 'chess' && 'one-cent-a-year-vs.-zero-cents-a-year-narrative' does ... because then I sense 'who the f*ck gaslights my one-cent-a-year' narrative, but with ai chatbot -- you cannot detect 'being gaslighted into an existential overwhelm' because, 'daaaaahhhh your ai is still sh*t it doesn't even understand some of my queries, what a stupid shit and you're still useless etc. etc. etc.' -- kind of gaslight ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ ... but ai is a probably a portal-of-entry nevertheless due to 'self-amusement' factor of it ...
[>>> 1.1.1.1.] ^^ What are the books between 'casual chats with chatgpt' and 'one-cent-a-year-narrative' (in a sense of a 'connection to one-cent-a-year narrative')? ==> See in 'chatgpt section' (tbd1,,)

[>] 'Disruptive technologies' && 'people are slowly catching up' (this document is not just a raw text file on a filesystem (whatever that means ...) ...) .. it has some 'quiz' fields ... blank line js methods ... maybe more/other features could be added ... worst case - minecraft on Ctrl-Alt-M (in webgl) ... (?)
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ You can't 'find' this document when 'trying to code' for this document ... it's a chicken-and-egg question ...

[>] Daily checks beside books: tai-chi copy-cat correctness and monetary accounting daily checks (because otherwise it even like that nearly impossible).
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Q. Why is this not a 'portal for reentry' and more importantly, how do I 'entrench' the daily finances checking routine, ?

References:
[>] (*1) ^^ [HUMAN\_DEPTH\_COMPLEXITY_1] Remember I've had this topic about 'games complexity' ... in 'losing this document' section? ==> Chess and 'shame-induced' 'self-harm' ... значит на улице все на тебя смотрят на твой холмик на лице и говорят сразу подсознательно 'чзх?!?!?' ('superficial dissing') и типа у тебя это 'отражается' как 'как ты смеешь показываться с таким уродством на улицу' и доходит до 'self-harm'a итп ..
[>>> 1.1.] А теперь ты говоришь что в конце теоретически доебавшись таким образом до тебя и захаяв и поставив тебя в угол ты им или ему можешь сказать: 'окей, ты говоришь что Я ничтожность, что Я такое х*йло -- давай тогда сыграем с тобой в такую-то такую-то игру ... и обыграть его 5 раз подряд с большой вероятностью' и это типа изменит его аттидьют из 'чзх?!?!?' в 'любопытство' ('ойй, а как это ты?!?') (и таким образом у меня спадет 'shame-induced' 'self-harm' по отношению к какому-то тому конкретному человеку ... (?)) ... и вероятно всего изменит внутреннее 'отражение' чужих взглядов (или только его конкретного взгляда? (?)) меньше в направлении 'self-harm'a ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ То есть если все смотрят с 'любопытством' это как-то 'неуютно' но не то что если все смотрят с 'чзх?!?!?!' взглядом (что доводило бы до 'селф-харм'а а не 'неуютности') ... и так не доходит до 'no bad parts frame rupture' (?)

Ты - х*йло! -- И у тебя опять до селф-харма и дойдет и опять из дома никуда высовываться не сможешь, неговоря уже об накапливающемся мусоре в квартире горами итп. 
[>>> 1.1.1.1.1.] ^^ Point being, that this might be exactly the dynamic that lies behind those 'Pete Walker's' 'CPTSD Flashbacks' that need you to 'search' for 'portals for reentry' in a sense that somehow, people through some noise dynamics can manipulate you into 'чзх?!?!?!' overwhelm (aka. ''wtf is this sh*t?' ddos overwhelm' / 'superficial dissing overwhelm') ==> which might require to 'reinforce' / 'reinstate' / 'reaffirm' your chess & complex games skills (again, gtfo of those gps locations as soon as possible! Govt doesn't care! --> you should care! ...)
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ Q. Again, why choosing and studying a 'weaker' game might be a problem? 
[@ ^ 2.1.] ^^ A1: Again, because, в третий раз подряд он тебя таки сможет обыграть - и скажет -- ну вот ... Я же говорил что ты л*х. А если выберешь с максимально возможной комплексностью игру то меньше таких шансов что ты ему проиграешь за 5 игр ... (tbd1,,)

[>] (*2) Minecraft helps with 'beyond self disciplining states' and/or 'situational overwhelms that 'sweep you off your feet' in a 'bad' sense of a word' ...

[@ ^ 2.] [DO_NOT_ASK_1] One important caveat: it is possible that if you ask on reddit for 'seed string' for minecraft 1.19 forest-only world -- it will never be answered and will again destroy the property of minecraft being 'portal for reentry', hence:
[@ ^ 2.1.] ^^ Portal for reentry property of minecraft is only preserved when you don't escalate it to 'online q&a' but rather slowly systematically studying everything (java, opengl, step-through-debugging-and-commenting) that is related to minecraft ... for the said 'situational overwhelms' mentioned above ...
[@ ^ 3.] Q. Why shouldn't I ask about minecraft coding online?

[#] Misc Notes - Ways To Lose Access To This Document
// [#] Misc Note - Not Losing This Document (since it requires both 100$ in BTC and also Minecraft)

First off, wtf do I even need this document for?
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ You need 'bonding leverage' for 'lipton tea' and if you have a decent 'bonding leverage', then this automatically assumes the existence of this document.

How Can I lose access to this document?
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ By losing 'internet & privacy' ...
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ Eyesight loss, loss of hand(s), huge physical crippling that makes impossible to work with a computer.
[@ ^ 3.] ^^ 'Nothing is waiting for me ahead' 'it's all a f*cking turmoil' states that cause me to 'miss out' on 'coercion'/'silkom' (rus) that is mounting against me slowly-slowly ...
[@ ^ 3.1.] ^^ I needed to do self-tai-chi & shogi to be able to 'process' this clause above ^^ ... 

Section: Stages of 'losing this document' (both within this document and beyond it)

[>] Q. How can 'beyond it' happen? 
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Some sort of medical emergency that requires urgent medical attention (e.g. a fallen bleeding tooth.)

Stages of loss (in brief) (situational)
[@ ^ 1.] Memory loss (of existence this document altogether)
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^ No bitcoin no more ==> Then it just becomes some 'another' document in the filesystem ...

[@ ^ 2.] 'Ideological loss' (aka. persistent 'wtf's' or some other)
[@ ^ 2.1.] ^^ Most likely due to some sort of 'r/mengetrapedtoo' surrounding dynamic (wtf were there some distinct knocks once in 5-10 minutes, that corresponded to distressing thoughts of mine? (?)) ==> They know something that I don't hence 'r/mengetrapedtoo' dynamic of sorts.

[@ ^ 3.] 'Maintaining existing elo rating' in some area hyper-focus ability?
[@ ^ 3.1.] ^^ Most likely it is the lesser loss of them all, because there are always boundaries between men, as 3mp-apr && mp-3mp-apr has shown.
[@ ^ 3.1.1.] ^^ For now the most favorite is: { 'elo rating' && 'distress books' }

[@ ^ 4.] ^^ 'Track of time' loss ==> When you forget to discern between 'before 6PM' and 'after 6PM' activities ...

[@ ^ 4.] ^^ Actual airdrop farming loss ==> This is yes considered a loss, in a sense that, those are 'playing lottery' mostly
[@ ^ 4.1.] ^^ You might just have enough from mining to 'fill up to 100$ in bitcoin for the next 20 years' (although I need to find a way somehow to be persistent in regard to 'gaming pc' so I could at least have a mining possibility)
[@ ^ 4.1.1.] ^^ So hencefor it's a loss, as in I don't know how to really petition for gaming pc ==> So it's an exponential loss 'rabbit hole'.

[@ ^ 5.] ^^ Lifetime crypto narrative can help with 'silkom' in a sense that 'silkom' coercion might disconnect me from this document. ==> So I'm putting this here, because, it definitely doesn't belong to 'paper clog resolving' yet it came up to mind when I was 'trembling' for 'stages of loss' of this document ... (so initially I've written it into 'wtf paper' section ... but then it clearly didn't fit there ... so I'm putting it here instead ... (as a 'stage of loss'? hmmm ...)) ... 

[@ ^ 6.] ^ 'Varlakova excercise' loss ==> e.g. when it feels that the right thing to do right now is to 'focus on varlakova excercise'
[@ ^ 6.1.] ^^ Why is it a more 'loss' then 'elo rating' loss? ==> Again, not taking 'boundaries between men' into account (so hence it 'feels' like a more of a 'loss' than 'elo-rating' loss ) ...

[@ ^ 7.] ^ 'Crawling towards ifs therapist' mode ...
[@ ^ 7.1.] [PROBABLY_ABOVE_PAPER_CLOG_RESOLVING_1] ^^ This is probably above 'paper clog resolving' because there is such section is yes within this document ...
[@ ^ 7.2.] [PROBABLY_NEED_MINECRAFT_FOR_CHAT_POST_AGITATION_1] ^^ Just noting though ==> You might also probably need 'minecraft' (or 'minecraft coding' (or very least 'minecraft book' 'checking-up on' aka 'distress reading'), on top of 'longhand paper' (with a clog or without) to avoid the, umm, the 'sporaidic tongue slips into ifs zoom chats and discords' ...
[@ ^ 7.2.1.] ^^ The name for tongue slips was 'chat post agitation' (without a planned delay of one day before concieving and posting (!!))
[@ ^ 7.3.] ^^ r/MenGetRapedToo dynamic might be at large at play here ... (there was also thoughts about { 'evidence flipping' 'social proof' } -- but again ... this might be a 'subset' of some general ongoing r/MenGetRapedToo dynamic (whose nuances I don't fully understand ... (due to not being their 'homie')) ...

[@ ^ 6.] ^ Paper clog resolving ==> Probably even more loss than 'varlakova' because the 'methodology of it' is beyond the scope of this document ... (aka if I'm focusing extensively on 'paper clog' for, say 48-72 hours then I'm clearly am not focusing on this document ...

Stages of loss (non-situational (aka not due some 'situational distress' that you have to 'tremble for', to 'find')) (e.g. doesn't change from 6-8-10 AM to 6-8-10 PM):

[@ ^ 1.] Neglecting minecraft coding for many many days ...
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ My estimation that minecraft is ~ 2% complete (no android version, no encrypted signs, no Ctrl-M webgl, textures are sh*tty, no 'portals',  ... (tbd1,,))
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ Testnets are not 'consistent' so it's 100$ in BTC and also is yes minecraft (I wish I had 100k$ in btc, though).

[@ ^ 2.] Losing this document by failing to negotiate properly with parents and family ...

[@ ^ 3.] Existence & availability of gains.trade 'practice mode' -- helps with 'гулкая голова' ... (and 'гулкая голова' can make me go ballistic and temporarily (situationally) lose access to this document ...)
[@ 

[@ ^ 2.] Not visiting shore border every 72 hours could cause me lose this document? (?)
[@ ^ 2.1.] ^^ Getting out in sloppy/negligient clothing and grooming is a sort of a 'noncomformism' that is 'designed' to 'plow through' 'toxic shame' (see separate topic on that) and henceforth, like any noncomformism will be pecked at by angry cops so grounding in 'police apprehension protocol' books could be important for 'not losing this document'? (maybe I'm getting too carried away here ... (?))

[@ ^ 5.] [DISRUPT_1] ^^ 'This document is a semi-public website with a legal disclamer, heh? It helps you sometimes when traveling outside, heh? It's a disruptive technology, heh? And people are slowly catching up, heh? So it might be that slowly slowly, in the future, this website's helpfulness effect might be severely diminished, heh? (?) 
[@ ^ 5.1.] ^^ I'm just speculating here, you know ...
[@ ^ 5.1.1.] ^^ In a sense that when everyone and his mother has a semi-public website then traveling outside factor of such website would be nonexistent, heh? Like e.g. when only you have a fridge and everyone else has to hop to a store to buy ice, you feel relative comfort.
[@ ^ 5.1.1.1.] ^^ So it might be not exactly how I lose this document, like in a few years ... but might theoretically happen so that even this document will get lost in the pile of 'filesystem' and I 'just won't find ... just won't find ...'

Section: Q. What to do when glided off this document, to, say, onto 'paper clog' resolving and can't touch this document for a long time still nevertheless still?

[>] ^^ A1: Tooth doctor calmed 'a little' the 'beyond 'too much spirituality'' status of my falling tooth. He, aka a certified MD doctor, has sad that by him - it is acceptable that a tooth will fall by itself, and that he doesn't see some sort of horrific medical emergency beside giving me an antibiotic, should there be an inflammation. Aka it's not 'negligience' of immense degree (if I only had a ferrari).

[>] ^^ 'Distress books' && 'ELO rating' is still insofar your best chance to save most possible organs in the body (because it ...)
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ That's so far an opinion (though maybe possible that I will be able to visit another tooth doctor in the future) ...
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ The rationale being: 
[@ ^ 2.1.] ^^ I'm able to 'open up' about much more things with myself, due to 'immersive places' promixity ... 
[@ ^ 2.2.] ^^ Less 'beyond self-disciplining' periods ... (that possibly happen due to some sort of ongoing 'r/mengetrapedtoo' resembling dynamic in petah tikva, that 
is not even my business and never was) ...
[@ ^ 2.3.] ^^ Urgency flipping - again possibly happens due to some sort of 'r/mengetrapedtoo' resembling dynamic in 'petah tikva' ...
[@ ^ 2.4.] ^^ Much, much better chance to preserve own 'self-leadership' whilst being 'bankrupt' (because really when no-bad-parts-frame-rupture ensues and there's no money -- that's not exactly going to be 'ifs therapist' ) ...
[@ ^ 2.4.1.] ^^ e.g. the 'ifs' is not a 'cover-all-umbrella' and it has an 'abyss' within it. Without addressing that ifs-and-bankrupcy--abyss it's much more difficult to address 'rotting teeth' ...

[>] ^^ I'm not even sure that I can go to bjj with a 'dental implant' (tbd1,,)

Misc Notes (tosort):

[>] [MEN_GET_RAPED_TOO_1] 'r/MenGetRapedToo' is a very dim light in eckhart tolle gloom ...

[>] So let's say we've focused on 'Distress Books' till 6PM -- and now 6 PM Came ... (tbd1,,)

[>] [GAMES_HUMAN_COMPLEXITY_1] Chess and 'shame-induced' 'self-harm' ... значит на улице все на тебя смотрят на твой холмик на лице и говорят сразу подсознательно 'чзх?!?!?' и типа у тебя это 'отражается' как 'как ты смеешь показываться с таким уродством на улицу' и доходит до 'self-harm'a итп ..
[>>> 1.1.] А теперь ты говоришь что в конце теоретически доебавшись таким образом до тебя и захаяв и поставив тебя в угол ты им или ему можешь сказать: 'окей, ты говоришь что Я ничтожность, что Я такое х*йло -- давай тогда сыграем с тобой в такую-то такую-то игру ... и обыграть его 5 раз подряд с большой вероятностью' и это типа изменит его аттидьют из 'чзх?!?!?' в 'любопытство' ('ойй, а как это ты?!?') (и таким образом у меня спадет 'shame-induced' 'self-harm' по отношению к какому-то тому конкретному человеку ... (?)) ... и вероятно всего изменит внутреннее 'отражение' чужих взглядов (или только его конкретного взгляда? (?)) меньше в направлении 'self-harm'a ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ То есть если все смотрят с 'любопытством' это как-то 'неуютно' но не то что если все смотрят с 'чзх?!?!?!' взглядом (что доводило бы до 'селф-харм'а а не 'неуютности') ... и так не доходит до 'no bad parts frame rupture' (?)
[>>> 1.2.] [YOU_CHOOSE_WHICH_GAME_1] ^^ Прикол он однако так-же в том -- что это _ты_ выбираешь какую игру ему предложить чтобы с ним сыграть, и ты выбираешь именно ту игру в которой 'mastery' берет долгие-долгие годы (и тогда больше вероятности что ты рандомального чела на улице сможешь обыграть 5 раз подряд ...) ... чем если скажем ты возьмешь тетрис аттак, а у него природная реакция лучше и он тебя через 3 матча обосрет, и скажет -- а аа -- Я же говорил 'чзх!?!?!?' -- вот ... как собственно Я и говорил! Ты - х*йло! -- И у тебя опять до селф-харма и дойдет и опять из дома никуда высовываться не сможешь, неговоря уже об накапливающемся мусоре в квартире горами итп. 
[>>> 1.3.] ^^ So this is sort of a 'lurking' dynamic that most likely will become more apparent in the future as I age ... (as a foreign immigrant in some foreign gps location) ...
[>>> 1.4.] ^^ You could also 'mix' it with 'grimacing shibashi' to even more reduce 'shame-induced' 'self-harm' effect ... (?) (or so it feels (a gut feeling)) (?)
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ Q. Again, why choosing and studying a 'weaker' game might be a problem? 
[@ ^ 2.1.] ^^ A1: Again, because, в третий раз подряд он тебя таки сможет обыграть - и скажет -- ну вот ... Я же говорил что ты л*х. А если выберешь с максимально возможной комплексностью игру то меньше таких шансов что ты ему проиграешь за 5 игр ... (tbd1,,)

[>] [PAPER_CLOG_AND_LOSING_THIS_DOCUMENT_1] Finding way back to this document through longhand paper: *MUST DISCARD THAT PAPER* that's a big key. If you use paper to find this document -- with accumulating clog -- you'll look - and never find ... never find ... never find ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Paper is better than computer in times of extreme head nausea. Because you don't trust yourself to get to computer because you'll watch endlessly that twitter feed.
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ So I suppose one activity - is to sift repeatedly through accumulated piles of paper for 1000th time, and discard, if possible! (that's a one missing key)

[>] [LOSING_CONSCIOUSNESS_1] Trying to 'make order' in 'paper clog' activities ==> What eventually ends up happening, that I get 'lost' again (because, ha! - { paper clog } is not { 'this document' } and doesn't have neither '100$ in bitcoin' nor 'minecraft coding' attached to it) (very quick, within few hours or a day or two (again, most likely due to that r/mengetrapedtoo dynamic, that is enshrined here somehow or something ...)) -- so then the most 'rational' solution would be is to 'train through injuries' (aka. like Quinton Jackson or somebody else that I don't want to mention here ...) aka 'neglect & ignore medical emergencies' just for sakes to 'not get lost again' (until I've lost conscious aka 'ability to focus' on anything at all ... (e.g. unconsciously hospitalized without being able to control it, at all)) ...

[>] ^^ Tremble for 'paper clog' (or 'this document') ...
[@ ^ 1.] Wtf tremble for 'paper clog'? ==> Sometimes I can't access to the pc b/c I know I'll watch twitter for hours and nothing will be done and I'm lost.
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ 'Trauma Grounding' via paper is impossible if a clog gets accumulated ... ==> This is definitely an incoherence for many reasons ...
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ One reason for resolving paper clog is - because I myself wrote 'todisp_1' on each page specifically ... a neglect could grow into, m, 'shoving things under the rug' and '5000 depot shots won't help' ... so it's either 'this document' or 'paper clog' ...
[@ ^ 2.] Wtf tremble for this document? ==> See notes above 'how can I lose access to this document?'
[@ ^ 3.] Taking a wild assumption here ==> Drop them in the evening into in-house garbage can ...

[>] [TAI_CHI_IMAGES_1] ^^ Also in the evening try to organise shibashi and then tai-chi images with red arrows.

[>] Mining card repair && buying rack still is relevant - it earns me 48$/year and can make this document hold, should I transfer all my earnings of rvn/ubiq into bitcoin (no need for leverage trading and/or evmos staking whatsoever (if I manage to keep programming the minecraft around this document))
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Most likely github will stay free ... (or it's clones) ...

<script name="tag: human_games_complexity_tag_1,, games_human_depth_tag_1,, games_human_complexity_tag_1,,">deleteEmptyLineTry1(document.currentScript);</script>
[#] Misc Notes - Games Complexity ... (human games complexity/depth) - a separate section (since it 'itches') ...

Preamble:
[>] Q. So, why such an excitement in regard to 'complex games'?
[@ ^ 1.] Basically we've asserted earlier, that, m, there is always boundaries between men (due to an 'infected laptop') and then there is an assumption that 'being lost' (e.g. in pink) is even worse than being subservient to some male, even if it is a power-abusing/authority-abusing male ...
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ And henceforth there raises a question to how to from 'being lost' state to get as quickly as possible to 'sensing boundaries' with some male (because there are always are ones those) ... and one such a vehicle is to study a complex game and 'try it out' on 'different surrounding (and non surrounding) people' (aka. a process that happens subconsciously when studying chess) ...
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ The 'finding boundaries with other people' make sense when you're 'floating in pink' for five days and unable to find yourself an fall asleep in yaar bon park ... and get apprehended by the police and that is a form of an unexpected bad surprise, something you don't want, even though sometimes you're in 'enjoy rape in prison' states (but then r/mengetrapedtoo hopefully 'snaps you out') so yes ... getting apprehended by the police is bad, m'kay?
[@ ^ 1.1.1.1.] ^^ But on top of that - if we do agree (hopefully through r/mengetrapedtoo books & subreddits) that getting apprehended by the police after falling asleep in the bushes - is yes 'bad' ... then supposedly 'finding boudaries with men' via 'playing chess' is better than 'floating in pink for 5 days' ... hence the excitement around 'complex games' ...
[@ ^ 1.1.1.1.1.] ^^ Again, if you remember from 'stages of losing this document' section,, being in 'maintaining the same elo level with { <insert here some topic-or-theme--of-interest> } ... ' state is probably the 'least bottomless pit' state ... because the boundaries with other men always exist (we know that from 3mp-apr paper experiment) ... so it's either you 'see' them ... or you 'don't' ...

[>] ^^ To recap and elaborate:
[@ ^ 1.] Any 'regular social activity' whether it's 'going to chess teacher' or 'nadine lucas zoom group' or 'ifs therapist' -- is a 'bottomless pit' (because it introduces 'ban related destabilisation' as has happened with 'xyk' on '#rschizophrenia' as he started lashing out at me for always shutting up and accused me of logging the channel and distributing/publishing it somewhere.
[@ ^ 2.] (there are 3, tbd1) ==> Second has to do with 'stages of losing this document' and 'maintaining the same elo rating' at any one particular subject is being 'on the top' because with any particular subject of knowledge either your knowledge is 'sub-par' to the 'top expert in that area' or 'less sub-par to him' (but again now we're talking about 'human boundaries' with 'expert in some area of knowledge' -- so it's again 'human boundaries' so it's again 'elo' and anything less is in some sort of way - 'sub-par' because all the knowledge in some 'xxx area' is relative to the knowledge of a person who is a 'top expert in that area' so you must 'sense the boundaries' to go as quickly as possible towards the 'top expertise' in that area)
[@ ^ 3.] There will always be boundaries and will never cease to be (as was proven with '3mp-apr' && 'mp-3mp-apr' 'infected laptop' experiment) 
[@ ^ 4.] ^^ Anything else? ==> Yes, there's 'evidence flipping' 'socially proofed' knockos (if you avoid any social contact, even if it could mean a 'ban-related destabilization' == it still could mean that you are then attacked with 'there's too many of us and there's only one of him' attack) 
[@ ^ 5.] ^^ Anything else? (?)

[>] [GAMES_HUMAN_COMPLEXITY_1] Chess and 'shame-induced' 'self-harm' ... значит на улице все на тебя смотрят на твой холмик на лице и говорят сразу подсознательно 'чзх?!?!?' и типа у тебя это 'отражается' как 'как ты смеешь показываться с таким уродством на улицу' и доходит до 'self-harm'a итп ..

[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ То есть если все смотрят с 'любопытством' это как-то 'неуютно' но не то что если все смотрят с 'чзх?!?!?!' взглядом (что доводило бы до 'селф-харм'а а не 'неуютности') ... и так не доходит до 'no bad parts frame rupture' (?)

Preamble 2 - Lesser trollable games:

[>] In tetris attack - speed of reaction matters.
[>] In 'brown dust' - you could buy 5-star heroes (somebody very rich could still say ...)
[>] In civ5 - there are new versions (so the factor of 'studying the game for 20 years and then consecutively get 5 wins from a person' diminishes (because now there's civ6 - 'why don't we play civ6 instead?' ==> 'I told you you're sh*t')

Other notes:
[>] Sometimes I feel like asking on the internet : can you suggest a paper similar to 'depth balancing and limits of the elo model' by 'cauwet, teydaud' et. al. ... and the answer is ... 
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Probably you don't want to do that to find out that the game of go that you've been studying for all these years is not 'complex enough' and you have to 'restart' from scratch ... and then shoot yourself in the head for 1000 times ...
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ Talking to michael about 'wtf, you were better off than me' - will just provoke the 'atudai-atudai' response ...
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ Israel is a village? ==> Israel is a village.

[#] Misc Notes - Frame With Chess Teacher ...

Preamble 1:

[>] The idea is to counter 'Evidence-flipping' 'socially-proofed' knockos (without much regard to 'games complexity' because probably there's even less baduk teachers in israel  ...) (aka all games that larry kaufman, who is chess GM compared ...)

[>] Also, the idea is to not talk to chess teacher about topics other than chess, just need to get from him that 'переглянуться с кем-то, и сказать - чзх?!?!?' vibe  ...

Preamble 2:
[>] Does region in which chess teacher resides, matter? I a sense of 'lesser embodiment region' vs. 'better embodiment region'?

Preamble 3 - wtf chess teacher on top of offline katrain & texel - from my own perspective (not something that I might want to share with him one way or another):

[>] 'Evidence-flipping' 'socially-proofed' knockos ... 

Preamble 3 - tbd1,,,,

[>] Q. If i don't want to discuss this with anyone, then how will I pay to chess teacher?

[>] ^^ With father, probably shouldn't talk ... 

Preamble 5 - Chess Teacher focus. vs. 'Key Portals For Reentry' focus ...

[>] Another point-of-view: A your-own-semi-useless-software you write is still super-unique in a sense that one ahk script might make you more 'unique' than what you would have been if you studied chess for 20 years ... and in that sense, maybe 'plowing through' to chess teacher as a response to 'evidence flipped' 'socially proofed' knockos might not pay off in the long term as well as 'own-semi-useless-ahk-scripts writing' although this is a defininitely a debatory/debated point.

What I don't talk about with him (aka my 'why's')
[>] r/MenGetRapedToo ...

[>] If he improves my 'game' something that I haven't thought about (aka 'subtle win over an armateur chess teacher') before him, ih my head ... if he makes me 'notice' something that I didn't -- then he 'deserves' another 5-10 lessons ...

My frame with him

[##] Preamble ...

[>] ^^ Sometimes I get here after 'dtao' ... (rarely am I capable to think like that ...)

[>] ^^ After each neighbor knock - I'm saying 'another gaslight' ... don't know how over the long term this will f*ck me up!

[>] Q. Wtf are dtao needed?
[@ ^ 1.] A1: For now, please re-read section 'Polarization: Father and Gush Agadol Polarization (or maybe more than one)'

[>] Program homebrew semi-useful apps with chatgpt to sustain insanity of it all. When want to publish something online - it has to be tangentially correlated with chess. Disruptive technologies - people (incl. him) are slowly catching up. This could in short-term reduce fainting. Over the long term - I don't know. If you have 'nothing to program' then start with '5+5 excercise' and improve your sw-kata (with chatgpt).

[##] Preamble - Assume I was super-human -- I feel the hint of daily-warmup routine ... -- what is it?

[###] Assuming I was super-human - What comes before - palpating 

[>] Q. What comes before { { making my own chess engine with chatgpt } && { memorising protector questions with chatgpt } && { Shibashi, Move-Only-Tai-Chi and all related work } } ? ==> 'Distress books' && publishing on the internet only what's tangentially correlated with chess/go/shogi/xiangqi (due to f*cking 'ChatGPT' advent overwhelm that destroyed my distress-books-grounding routine, again.)

[>] Q. What comes before 'airdrops time tracking'? ==> Firstly, (1) Making own chess/go engine with help of chatgpt and secondly, (2) memorising protector questions for overwhelms, with help of chatgpt and thirdly - (3) Shibashi (and all related work (incl. offline building pictures sequence of shibashi sequence)) and then Non-Martial Copy-cat Tai-Chi (as if it were without martial moves (as a natural 108 progression of 20 shibashi)).
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Probably the 'martial aspect of tai-chi' should somehow come through memorising ifs-protector-questions (aka. it's f*cking trauma of a kind) ...

[>] Q. What comes before 'crypto-security--pomodoro-time-tracking--organisation' ==>  Getting to a place where I 'track' my 'airdrops' and 'testnets' via. 'pomodoro technique' ...

[>] Q. What comes before dtao? ==> 'crypto-security--pomodoro-time-tracking--organisation'

[>] Q. What comes before sw kata? ==> Dtao (frontal collision dtao).

[####] Q. What comes before { One-cent-a-year vs. Zero-cents-a-year } narrative - pomodoro time tracking? (the less immediately obvious steps)

[>] ^^ Getting to 'computer security' (and maybe also 'crypto-security') 'pomodoro-style' 'time-tracking' ...

[####] Q. What comes before { One-cent-a-year vs. Zero-cents-a-year } narrative - pomodoro time tracking? (the more 'immediately obvious' steps)

[>] Q. What comes after 'airdrops time tracking' and 'making-own-chess-engine-with-chatgpt && memorising-protector-questions-with-chatgpt && shibashi-pictures-organizing'? ==> 'Crypto Security' 'pomodoro time tracking' organisaton (either on paper or in some file (but it must be a written text, in this case 'pomodoro time tracking' of crypto-security topics will rarely work in-the-head))

----
[>] Q. What comes after sw kata? ==> One-cent-a-year vs. Zero-cents-a-year narrative - pomodoro time tracking

[>] Q. What comes after One-cent-a-year vs. Zero-cents-a-year narrative - pomodoro time tracking? ==> Write a sentence on longhand paper about relation to yourself. Ты мне дорог / Я принимаю итп. (There's a benefits to writing things on longhand paper. Just Ask ChatGPT. He agrees ...)

[>] Q. What comes after writing sentences on longhand paper? ==> Disposing of paper and trauma work ... 

[>] Q. What comes 'disposing of paper' and 'trauma work'? ==> 'Trembling' for 'Varlakova' excercise 

[##] Preamble - What are some necessary pomodoro-time-tracking chunks that I need to address at least once-a-few-days (without order)

[###] Grounders that are before pomodoro, when we're not even start talking about pomodoro - level 0 (something's 'broken' in my mind) ...

[>] 'Losing this document' (inability to get back to 'focusing' on this document)

[###] Grounders that are before pomodoro, level 6 (logistics) (something broken not in my mind, but in logistics, mind-blog interface, laptop, peripherals, food, money (cash), hardware/software/bitcoin/minecraft, bycicle etc.)

[>] ^^ Minecraft got erased / Bitcoin plummeted to 0$ and solana/phantom was hacked, an unable to get to 100$ in bitcoin / computer burned & malfunctioned / bycicle malfunctioned / tbd1 ... 
[@ ^ 1.] Elaborating (what else could go wrong in human-myblog112 interface):
[@ ^ 1.1.] Computer or a mining card malfunctioned.
[@ ^ 1.2.] Father casually decided to gaslight me so, that I won't have any more money (after all, I'm dancing on his pole).
[@ ^ 1.3.] [SEVERE_MALNUTRITION_1] ^^ Severe malnutrition: no schnitzel, banana, tea, etc ... - no pomodoro will most likely not work here (esp. with addition of pertenient 'aggressive gaslighting') ...
[@ ^ 1.4.] Money-to-receipts exchange clog (aviator? (?))

[###] Grounders that are before pomodoro, level 10 (when we can yes focus on this document, but still unable to focus on any 'pomodoro specifically' ) 

[>] ^^ 'Making a chess engine of my own with help of chatGPT' -- no 'pomodoro' applies here somehow yet this is super-important grounding activity.

[>] ^^ Memorising ifs protector questions for overwhelms with help of chatgpt -- no 'pomodoro' applies here somehow (this 'ideally' should be 'done' in my mind as a 'super-human' haha) ...

[>] ^^ Shibashi-in-pictures (and other moving meditations beyond shibashi).
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Tai-chi needs free-to-yell zone, yet getting outside and plowing-through multi-cultural eye-contact-innuendos in-tha-elevator-and-beyond might require some additional rooting-in-books (to not get to "f*ck you, you darned inner critics, tired of y'all" states) ...

[###] Pomodoro themes (tbd1,,) ...

[>] ^^ Computer security - as much as possible (a 'grounder' amidst crazy, overwhelming voices)

[>] ^^ Emergency tooth cleaning - 4 x 5 mins.


[##] Misc Notes (of 'least bad trajectories' section) 

[>] Theoretically speaking, there are always 'subtle' (or 'not-so-subtle') boundaries between males ... and ... with 'ifs', under all 'books' and 'vast trees of theory' - they are 'still to be found' ... which is not to my advantage because when I 'find' those boundaries, I will be probably 'subservient' which might be 'ok' (richard schwartz also needed other therapists at some points) but not 'ideal' (especially if you're locked-in with him for a longer term). (why did I write this? (?)) ...

[#] Misc Notes - 'Trembling' for 'Silkom' coersion ...

Preamble 1 - Why I think I should even care:

[>] What MRA/LWMA/MenGetRapedToo taught me? (tbd1,,

Preamble 2 - Why I think sometimes that could be held responsible for that parents' (or whoevers) fuckup?

[>] What 'Tyler Durden' && 'Eckhart Tolle' && 'Hanan Sagiv' && 'Mehmet-oz' did ...
[@ ^ 1.] Tyler made me ashamed of my 'ego projection' (it is 'evil')
[@ ^ 1.] Eckhart & Other NLP practitioners have taught me 'spiritual bypass' (aka. 'just dissociate' && 'f*ck it') 

[>] What 'James Duane' && 'Innocence Project' group taught me
[@ ^ 1.] tbd1,,

Preamble 3 - Why after all I know, I think I still should be afraid of 'confrontation' and 'escalation' with parents and psychiatry?

[>] I still smoke cigarettes and I might not be able to climb back onto favoxil, before parents escalate (and with smoking, under hospitalisation & forced-in-your-throat pills) - this might be very risky, to say it mildly ...

Preamble 5 - What I wish I had (what would help me but alas is gone)

[>] [GAINS_TRADE_1] So far, I can't 100% rely on 'gains.trade' (for negotiation 'wtf I have this trump card' leverage) practice mode because they can shut it off at any time. So it's important to do some steps to replicate gains.trade practice mode ('at least I tried ...') ...

[>] [BONDING_LEVERAGE_FOR_NEGOTIATION_1] So far, I can't rely on 8-9k$ for negotiation 'wtf I have this trump card' leverage - because those are non-methodological and not systematic.

Preamble 8  - Preceeding Context Try 1:

[>>> 1.1.] ^^ But then again, this spirals me into infinite dilemmas about what am I to send him (thanks, knockorz, who probably got infinite amount of monero, so that they could 'back up' their 'stifledness' checks every 5 minutes (in a 'who's the most unstiffled person in the building' competition dynamic)) and eventually effectively makes me _unable_ to send him sh*t which in turn 'strengthengs' his 'claim' that I'm a 'lazy'/'worthless' bum (his 'fingerprint'/'cornerstone' gaslight) ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ So what am I to do what am I to do what am I to do?!?!?

Overview (of line of defense):

[>] His gaslighting 'накаленный разговор' (cannot find, will have to 'improvise', by 'making it all about high-tech job'):
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Want to find from that phone call how did I call it 'заостренная зона?' ?

[>] Safety nets for his gaslights & backing up on promises (again, do not debate gaslighting with him, but to be able to guide myself from post-conversational glooms & twilights):
[@ ^ 1.] [SAFETY_NET] Posting him books summaries (of difference between '12 year-old smart contract developer' and '30 years old smart contract developer')

Tasks: (they are here):

[>] HDD Password on desktop pc - not done.

[>] ^^ So far, I can rely probably the best, on coding my own semi-useful projects (and minecraft) that might be semi-useful to me in the future (for myself) as my best chance of 'negotiation leverage' ...
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ How is that even a 'negotiation leverage'? (?)
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ A1: For example, this document is a semi-public website with a legal disclamer, heh? It helps you sometimes when traveling outside, heh? It's a disruptive technology, heh? And people are slowly catching up, heh? So it might be that slowly slowly, in the future, this website's helpfulness effect might be severely diminished, heh? (?) 
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ I'm just speculating here, you know ...
[@ ^ 1.1.1.1.] ^^ In a sense that when everyone and his mother has a semi-public website then 'traveling outside factor' of such website would be nonexistent, heh? Like e.g. when only you have a fridge and everyone else has to hop to a store to buy ice, you feel relative comfort.
[@ ^ 1.1.1.1.1.] ^^ So it might be not exactly how I lose this document, like in a few years ... but might theoretically happen so that even this document will get lost in the pile of 'filesystem' and I 'just won't find ... just won't find ...'

Tooth and 'gloom'/'twilight zone' (in regard to whatever to do next with a tooth):
[>] Врач вроде меня в отделение скорой помощи - не послал. Он сказал что может быть воспаление - и лицо может набухнуть и дал антибиотик на такой случай. 
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Но он так-же сказал, что, мол, м, мля -- останешься без зуба ... то есть по его версии/мнению - такие вещи бывают, и они типа с его точки зрения - приемлемы.
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ С моей стороны - мы хотим 'пережить' это 'медленное распадание' зуба - контроллировать на какой стороне лица мы не можем -- то что мы можем сделать - это чистить и полоскать зуб/рот один раз в день как мы с коронавирусом мыли руки. И покупали всегда мыло. Почистил/прополоснул когда встал -- подождал 5 минут -- продолжил свои дела. Ты после того как моешь руки - каждый раз не вкуриваешь ... но в любом случае ... просто хотим пережить распад зуба и чтобы не накапливалась там инфекция до того как щека разбухнет и прийдется там серьезно оперировать. Как и руки которые ты всегда моешь с коронавирусом. Просто не пропускать. 
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ Почистить 2 раза потому что основное кол-во пасты уходит на сломанный зуб -- во второй раз - акцентироваться на правой половине рта.
[@ ^ 1.1.1.1.] ^^ Второй раз - оставь на вечер ... вспомнишь или нет ... потому что у тебя проблеммы с памятью -- а пока - пусть остальные зубы гниют. Ты меня слышал.

[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Apparently, reading 'chess book' as a means of 'не краснеть перед учителем' после каждого урока - is then yes of importance, probably more of importance than a baduk/shogi/xiagqi book because it's that that chess teachers are prevalent in israel, and not go/baduk/shogi/xiangqi ones (simply because chess is the most popular of them all, and you're going to chess teacher not to play chess, but to verify 'переглянуться с кем-то и сказать 'чзx?!?!?'' amidst possibly 'evidence flipping' 'social proofed' certain types of neighbors, because even bjj doesn't work when the whole mob 'intentionaly' thinks differently).
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ I think the reason why 'chess teacher' does help with evidence-flipping social-proof yet regular bjj does not, is because in bjj there's also that dynamic of 'if lost to everyone and couldn't do a single mount/sweep' -- then you'll think that 'bjj is too much for you' etc and with chess teacher, if you lose to texel, pretty much nothing happens.

[#] Ifs Therapists Landscape Ban Discernance ('Ifs therapists incoherence') and what we are doing next

[>] ^^ Preamble: If you can't 'discern' between prison and freedom (for the sake of self-reprimanding via 'you'll lose 100$ in bicoin then you'll lose access to this document') then so far you can at least discern the 'ifs therapists landscape ban' vs. 'sleep doctor final verdict' 'in-between-chairs' situation as an 'undesireable' situation ... (even though 'rape in prison is yes 'enjoyable'' -- the {'ifs therapists landscape ban' vs. 'sleep doctor final verdict' in-between-chairs } is at least for now, still yet, just yet, is still yet - undesireable (in a sense of 'not enjoyable')
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ And the 'bigger' problem with it ... is that if I felt the difference between 'prison' and 'freedom' -- I could 'discipline' myself e.g. via 'if you leverage trade -- you'll go to prison!' but @#$% I can't even self-discipline myself here for that! (!!!) Damn! Damn! Damn! Damn! Damn!
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ So we're left with, like, m, 'tremble for that incoherence' (and hope and pray that we don't start liking the 'being between chairs' between { banned from all ifs therapist and 'sleep doctor final verdict' isn't 'in' yet } too ... just as we love already the 'rape in prison' thing ... ) (?)

[>] [2022.11.11 23:59] ^^ Update: apparently even the, m, hyper-focus on 'ifs therapists landscape ban' incoherence - кануло в канун (или в 'pink' х/з) --> I just stopped feeling even that 'boundary' !!! (!!!)
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Do not panic, probably it's because it doesn't address 'tai-chi'? ==> So then back to 'maintaining elo rating' of 'discernance' between 'prison' and 'freedom' ... (?)
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ Or back to 'ifs therapists' 'crawling mode' because I don't feel any boundary now whatsoever!!
[>>> 1.1.1.1.] ^^ Bye bye, 'books fasting' ... (?)

[>] [DRAFT_1] ^^ So then what are we doing next, according to that discernance?

[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Though again it has that 'looking too long into abyss' element so still you want to travel to n.q. from time to time to obtain that 'lesser-looking-into-abyss' 'prison-vs-freedom' discernance ...

Things to do:

[>] 'Books fasting' under 'leverage-trading-cheerleading' knockors ... 
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Since we're talking here about issues 'like' 'death' and 'suicide' -- maybe even listening to alex ham is a burnout (doesn't fit 'death' narrative) ... 
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ There were people not long ago who lived on books only. Didn't know about guitars. My head is over-buzzing from whole-day-twitter viewing. 
[>>> 1.1.1.1.] ^^ So refer back to 'distress_books_1' section even after 6PM.

[>] 'Distress coding' (besides 'distress book') to 'keep'/'hold onto' this document (upto minecraft-in-webgl-on-ctrl-m) because 'death' is a 'tearing thing' surely it will tear this document apart - one way or another (either through clicking 'trade' button or some other 'unexpected bad surprise' scenario) ... ==> There's also 'distress coding to save this document' section ...

[>] 'r/MenGetRapedToo' is also very much related to 'sleep doctor final verdict' incoherence but I guess I have some 'exposure' to it through 'distress books' (in which 'mra/women/mengetraped' books also are included (see that 'distress_books_1' section (but last time I checked -- they are yes included there ...) ...) ...

[>] Coding father excercise - потому что ты понимаешь что они 'сильнее' потому что у них 'у миши', 'у папы' ... жизнь 'удалась' и по этой причине они 'сильнее' и писать программки чтобы сжалились над тобой/надо мной что мол когда разговор зайдет 'в тупик' опять -- каким то макаром выражать это через 'программу' но до 'силком' не довести (в худшем случае 'пересказывать' книгу своими словами) ...

Old-torevise-or-remove:
[>] Code minecraft in ecma script on Ctrl-M, and all preludes before that minecraft (After 6 PM).
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ How's that even related to that discernance? (?) ==> Well call that a 'hunch' since that one is 'looking too long into the abyss' and I can't tell you straight from abyss all the answers to all the 'why's' ... but then again if something better than this comes along then we'll probably know and prioritise ... (tbd1,,)
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ So for now we're doing what? The 'search in all db's' script? (tbd1,,)
[>>> 1.1.1.1.] ^^ The section of 'minecraft_homebrew_precursors_1_tag_1' was very difficult to find, so I had to resubmit trades at gains.io,, and most likely even with having one document -- they will be spread all over the document and there will be few inconsistencies on what's the next micro-step or next micro-pilot,, so worst case - you'll do two micro-pilots at once or one micro-pilot twice ... no biggie ... (it's _our_ homebrew ... ) ...

[>] Wtf Paper? Wtf?
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ It would cause immense calmness during 'catastrophes' (which inevitably of course this planet earth is not devoid of) or during 'devastating losses' or during 'inner-critic-overwhelm' states ... if I could just put all my thoughts on paper, as a 'calming'/'spindown' technique. And henceforth the paper serves as 'grounding' 'entry portal' to try and aspire to, if I lost this very document.
[@ ^ 2.] 'Я сейчас психану' - like states ...
[@ ^ 3.] ^^ 'Nowhere to 'shove' myself' - like -- states ...
[@ ^ 3.1.] ^^ Those sometimes happen few days after sporaidically 'stumbling upon' the even the 'smell' of michael's immigrational adaptation and success ...
[@ ^ 4.] ^^ If I'm still in some sort of undecided borderline medical emergency (that I can't focus on this document properly (thoughts take me 'away' (e.g. another tooth loss))) ==> and henceforth I need to clean up the clog for exactly those types of scenarios., 
[@ ^ 5.] ^^ In some 'ultra-dense population homes' there are _hours_ without 'definite descisions' where some descision jumps in but then it's clearly not what need be done (aka. 'подвешенность state') and ability to be able to freely write or even draw on paper without worries (ok, there are masturbations, I know, ...) during those states -- is paramount (?)

[@ ^ 1.1.] Advantage #1: It emphasized the ultra-importance of chess in my internal neural net (in my brain) ... earlier I've though 'hah, what is this shit crap chess anyway!?!?! wtf!?!?!' and now it's def changed so in a sense, I possibly got super-important reference experience here for 'almost free' (e.g. he has much more years kilometrage in life than I don't ) ...
[@ ^ 1.1.]

[##] Assuming you've held onto 'not letting go entirely of martial arts narrative':

[>] It wasn't out of 'recklessness' ... every time I told there was a 'deal' behind it ... first time when I told him about bridge, I needed him to stay with me in appartment in ramat aviv (b/c rent for 1 person for karni 19 street was 'too high') ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Next time I told him about 'CuckooChess' was because I needed to play with vitaly, because there was no other suitable male living there to even be able to discuss anything ... (to say it mildly)

[>] Baduk Books

[>] Chess books

[>] Xiangi & Shogi books

Category: Outside visit distress books:

[>] Police Apprehension Books ('non-comformism, for regardless of why it's needed, needs to be 'backed' against 'peckers' of sorts)

[>] How to pass exams - memorisation - books (maybe could help with 'states' when moving from one gps area to another) (aka. memorised protector questions help, whilst in state transitions)

Category: Nofap Books ...

[#] Misc Notes - Systematic methodological crypto routine -- when nothing else works - Try 1000 

[>] Does homebrew coding count towards palpation of crypto voice? ==> The answer is yes (if you can bring yourself to it).

[>] Do you enjoy 'rape in prison'?

<script name="tag: tetris_attack_tag_1,,">deleteEmptyLineTry1(document.currentScript);</script>
[#] Misc Notes - Tetris Attack and other Match-3 ...

[>] ^^ Whe an inner critic excessively calls me idiot ==> tbd1,,

[>] ^^ You can be a chess gm and still called 'idiot savant' (like kasparov was once called? (?))
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Fischer also said at one point that he himself was 'a genius who happened to play chess', as opposed to kasparov who ' might be called a chess genius, but he's like an idiot savant. Outside of chess he knows nothing.' (https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/dsl30u/fischers_hate_boner_for_kasparov/) 

[>] ^^ Idiot is someone who 'doesn't' 'notice patterns' (?)

[>] ^^ You can be 'antidote to idiot' and still not have '150 million $ in bitcoin' due to 'survivorship bias' (or in simple layman language: 'out of luck')

[>] Touch-play tetris attack ==> [Last Touch-Play: 2022.12.01 14:44]

[>] ^^ tbd1,,
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Idiot is some

[#] Psychiatry Defense - Context, analogies, etc.

Line of defense:
[>] I served 1.2 year - you served 6 years -- but that makes me '5/6 less moral then you', but not ammoral. (+ add 'HP arab programmers analogy') ...

[>] [CONTEXT_1] In HP some hr on a meeting told that they are going to accept arab programmers now ... and somebody commented ... so what ... I should be working with fear that he will stab me with a knife? (or something along this lines, but for a fact -- they did bring in some arab programmers whilst I was working there - you can check that yourself).

<script name="tag: suicide_tag_1,, onboarding_psychiatrist_1,,">deleteEmptyLineTry1(document.currentScript);</script>
[#] Misc Notes - Suicide ideations 

[>] ^^ Important dynamic to remember: 'forgot where you shoved your suicidal rope' (as. some 'palpative care patient')

Old age:
[>] ^^ So you'll live a shorter life, let's say 50 instead of median 80 ... not thinking about 'longer but more sh*tty life' (because that's 'looking into the abyss') ...

[>] ^^ If you're 100 years old and you're drowning -- you'll still be gasping for air (just as if you were 43 years old.).

[>] You might still need 'yourself' to confront the 'random justice' justice system ...

[>] In russia - I'd be probably dead ... so when do you 'stop trying' really?
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ You work with your parts ... and there's infinite work because in the end there is 'medusa wife' vs. 'reproductory repression' polarisation that never gets solved because it's not your own brain that is fully under your command so ...
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ Even if all childhood traumas ideally have been resolved ... there's still that one polarisation that is always actual and needs endless resolving of polarisations (can't control them women 100%, because it's not your own brain ...) ...
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ 'Medusa wife' will know that you don't want to 'amputate' your '21th finger' so she'll use it to extort you ... and there is a 'little' of 'medusa wife' in every woman most likely ...

[>] A body is born with existing, but limited capacities for self-revival ... and when those capacities are depleted (at 30 or at 50 or at 60 or at 80 or at 100 ...) the motor (heart) stops working (or the 'controller module' aka 'bakar' aka 'brain' (or the wiring between 'contoller' and 'motor') stops working ...) and the blood stops getting to the organs and a living organism whose cells need blood (to 'feed' nutrients & oxygen off it ...) ... 'decays into dust'. This might happen at 30 with heavy drug use (happened to some russian female singer I don't remember her name ...) might happen at 50 ... it's just considering all circumstances the average median for males (with average humanoid revival capacities that they are given at birth ...) is about 66.5 years or so ...
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ So it's either you 'play along' with those 'parts' ... or sometimes when parts start overwhelming and you're unable to cope and say 'f*ck yours!' then obviously some other potentially-vital organ starts most likely malfunctioning ... which could lead to 'bad body signals' and/or possibly more 'titanium plates' in various organs etc. But then again ... who said that 'population density' doesn't kill? Were there a 'research'?
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ Anyway, there are unlimited amount of polarisations due to 'reproductory repression' on one end and 'medusa wives' whom you can't 100% control - on the other end.
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ One point that I'm trying to make out of this ... is that I have been 'fatally wounded' in the face/cheekbone ... revival capacities don't care they just keep reviving until they too, get depleted ...

[#] Paper notes - Q & A (trhhhhhh)

Preamble:
[>] IMO, proper paper disposal depends on studying books of go, xiangqi, and shogi ... (with whatever resources are available to you)
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ And also reading 'games human complexity' papers, but exclude chess (even if it is the most complex game there is (because there's a huge traumatic injury associated with it ('e.g. 'wtf have you told' critic that bloodily spirals out of control and makes me self-hospitalize (and then say bye-bye to any 'longhand paper' whatsoever ...) ... ) ...) ...

[>] Dtao pages that are older than one year old - are properly ok to dispose of (unless there are notes in them) (f*cking make my tooth rot).

Onward, 1: 
[>] Q. Where do I shove paper notes?
[@ ^ 1.] ^ For the sake of transition to 'lesser urgency flipping' gps - first objective is to move them off paper (so he won't be able to easily access) into _this very document_ because beyond this document I'm getting lost in filesystem (there's section below this one which is called 'grounding paper notes')
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^ Then later, if you ever feel that this document grows beyond 500MB - then move them randomly into diary ... (as we do sometimes just randomly select 5 fkn notes and move them -- f*kn distress in petah-tikva - don't you see?!?!?) ....
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ The rationale being -- that _if_ I wrote them on paper (and not to here - instantly) then it was some sort of an emergency (otherwise why would I write them on paper and not to here straight into some db on fs? etc) .. and moving them 'at least somewhere' in computer ... make this 'less emergency' than it originally 'were' ...

// [#] Paper Notes - Nowehere to shove before I throw the paper page to garbage -- last ditch attempt

Preamble:
[>] Sometimes, when in huge 'petah-tikva' distress - and I cannot find my 'path' to this document -- I'm using paper for grounding. To find my path to this document. Back to this document. And sometimes this paper wants 'notes' to be 'transferred' somewhere -- so hope, that this section could serve as an intermediary -- to be able to dispose of paper and not accumulate that clog, and in 10 years, when I finally will be f*cking able to move to ramat aviv -- to dissolve it from here to other f*ckking places -- but first - get rid of the goddamn clog. Thank. You.
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Again, with 'r/mengetrapedplenty' in mind ... ==> accumulation of paper clog will eventually lead to a state similar to '5000 depot shots won't help him' and is very likely yes a 'red flag' that I should try and plow through and deal with (with the 'paper clog' ...) ...

had the notion that we have parts to the two horses the positive and the negative energies and the charioteer the tries to manage them Freud of course thought we
had parts the ideo and super-ego the idea that we have parts is one that scholars in our field have been writing about of late billiary Erica Fox Garry Friedman all of these books take as their premise that we are engaged in an internal negotiation all the time all of us and the people that we work with as well ... this article from several years ago 1998 by Max bazerman and colleagues is a wonderful introduction to this concept in this article the authors talk about us having basically two cells the want self which is impulsive and the should self which is rational in this a more recent article by Bob Borden and colleagues talking about how the internal negotiation over our identity and role plays an important function in our negotiations and then in the materials the for this talk you may have seen a link for this article and also for this shorter article and when you get the slides if you want to access these articles you'll have links to them finally in terms of this being a a model that is out there in the world if you have not seen the Academy award-winning movie inside out I encourage you to see it it depicts each of the people in the

[#] Tracking time spent on airdrop hunting (in 5 minutes chunks) (so you couldn't say that you're not hunting and no chance of future airdrops)

[>] ^^ So you couldn't say that you're not hunting and no chance of future airdrops ...

Preamble 1: 
[>] I agreed for 100$ BTC .. without further airdrop hunting, with condition that we are going to be actively developing minecraft -- otherwise 'all holes are going to be, m' ruptured again ... you say that, m, airdrop farming is inconsistent and non-systematic -- then f*cking do minecraft till the last whim of yours ... including portals, encryption, searchability, android, webgl, everything ...
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Simply reading all opengl and mod programming books (3 times) -- make the curve 'less steep' ... are you able to code in opengl like you are able to code in autohotkey? (whilst google searching only for 'things that you did in the past but just don't recall?) ... probably not ... because you don't have a lot of 'hands-on experience' with aforementioned having done all the possible 'tutorial pilots' ...
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ And I need this experience for 'disaster handling', for 'abysses'/'vastnesses' ... and future things that will 'sweep me off my feet' (in a bad sense of a word ...) ...
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ Monetary stuckness has a lot to do with this. So how many time did you invest today in minecraft?

[>] Minecraft 'sweeps me off my feet': [@ ^ 1.1.] 'Comfy Minecraft' existence helps with 'disaster handling',, for 'abysses'/'vastnesses' (in a bad sense of a word) that I meet in life ... and future natural (or or of other origin) disasters that will 'sweep me off my feet' (in a bad sense of a word ...) ...

[>] [MINECRAFT_REDUCING_STEEPNESS_1] Minecraft helps with beyond-self-disciplining in absense of 8-9k$ ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Reading and re-reading books steepens curve up to an extent of being able to code-up-a-feature-in-5-minutes like with autohotkey (remember how you were reading C book in электричка?)
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ Since airdrop hunting is mostly sporaidic and non-methodological ... minecraft is at least I can see how it can be methodological ... in a sense that I have inherent confidence that if I re-read minecraft book 5 times then I will be able to code minecraft features that I need without 'magic tricks' and 'игра на бубнах' (aka. 'conjuring-grade-activities' which is yes prevalent in airdrop hunting activities)

[>] [PERPS_PRACTICE_MODE_1] Practiced Gambling mode -- watching the prices of my 'fake' market positions swing up and down - helps me 'snap out' of some 'depressive/bad/disoptimistic/pessimistic' states ... and yet this feature can disappear at any time ... off the face of the internet ... so in that sense, again, tbd1,,

[>] ^^ Obviously not forgetting 'gmx.io' clone ...

[>] [PREFER_TESTNETS_1] If still slipping (unable to record 'time spent on airdrop hunting' into this document very very precisely) - prefer interacting with testnets rather than real monetary transactions (and also, dive straight into testnets, instead of 'reading guides' (because (1) reading is a headf*ck (2) lottery is a lottery (they might drop just 0.4$) ...

[>] [TALKING_ABOUT_PERPS_PRACTICE_MODE_1] Do not ask gains.trade about practice mode ... this will obviously make our situation worse ... what will simply happen is we will just go back into simpler airdrop farming but let's just not look into abyss ... in a sense that maybe by then a big flix/evmos airdrop will happen that will cover my 8-9k$ ... but maybe they will keep it for 5 years ... (who knows?) ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Definitely whatever they answer to me now regarding their plans is just an 'empty promise' and they can change it at any moment should they so desire -- not your website -- not your practice mode.

[>] [DO_NOT_GIVE_OUT_YOUR_CHESS_PIECES_FOR_FREE_1] Before interacting with internet (because you get sudden 'posting urges' out of the blue) (and especially also after those 'sudden posting urges'), touch-read some book on chess/go/xiangqi/shogi (as in. do not give out your chess pieces 'why does he never talk? Is he spying on us?') ...

[>] [EXPECTATIONS_1] So, basically, what can I really expect (with those 'let's check da twitter' style 'slips'):
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Basically, testnets are not going to be done much because of 2 reasons: (1) To fully complete a testnet - I need 20-30 minutes,, (2) Some testnets pay you 0.4$ for a hour's work (e.g. evmoswap)

[>] [MORE_EXPECTATIONS_1] So, again, with the paragraph above (what I can't really hope to expect) -- what can I yes expect?
[@ ^ 1.] Random discord roles with heavily funded projects (Across airdropped to discord roles),, random genesis nfts (games, aptos, etc.),, singular transactions on heavily funded networks (not tens of transactions) on a single wallet,, tbd1,,

[@ ^ 2.] [STUDY_PAST_PROMINENT_AIRDROPS_FOR_FURTHER_CALIBRATION_1] ^^ Some airdrops happened due to simple things such as joining a discord, claiming a role at some certain point, and that's it. (Study past big airdrops. See across airdrop. ...). So this could theoretically happen whilst browsing chats & twitter (sometimes there is some 'genesis monkey nft' to claim ... sometimes there is some minimal discord role claim,, (tbd1,,)) ..

[>] [TESTNETS_TRANSACTIONS_STUCK_MADNESS_1] Undefined time to completion of an atomic-micro-step (Testnets transactions stuck madness) ==> Obviously this shouldn't 'suppress'/'repress' all my day ... got to put some 'hard cap' here ... if 10 times a transaction didn't go through, then try the next day -- or, f*ck this testnet and it's 'promised' incentives!
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Transactions stuck on someone else's testnet without ever knowing ETA for a fix - is an 'overwhelm'.
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ 'Burnout / overwhelm' and 'one-cent-a-year' are 'misaligned narratives.
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Try another testnet instead? (there are like 5 active testnets ongoing in any existing moment) (?)

[>] [OVER_THE_DAYS_PLEASE_1] Let's try to stick, if possible to the narrative that any testnet & airdrop activities should be done over-the-days and what's not possible over-the-days -- is f*cking lost! Unless it's a _definite_ (not a 'speculative') loss of more than 100$ ... (e.g. if veHarbor is more than 100$).
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ E.g. if kuwa NFT claim ends tomorrow - then f*ck it! In that sense that we want to get to 8-9-20k$ within next 5-6 years (2022) and not go batshit crazy from airdrop jerky-hunting.

[>] Q. So theoretically any airdrop farming should be supressed, because it's non-systematic and non-methodological, right?
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ A1: There's 'one cent-a-year' is better than 'zero-cents-a-year' narrative ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ A1.1.: Currently, mining (*cough* *cough* 'gaming' card) supplies that narrative ... so you should keep insisting and asking them for it under guise of 'I'm overgambling', 'My interest to programming was provoked by gaming in childhood', etc etc etc. (or something along those lines ...)
[>>> 1.2.] ^^ A2: Without { '1 cent a year' is bigger than '0 cents a year' } I am getting lost in my programming -- don't know what am I programming for whom and from whom and for what purpose (at least under specific certain gps locations I am) ...

[>] [CHESS_AND_CRYPTO_TWITTER_1] If you feel like you're about to post some comment on crypto twitter (or crypto telegram) just suggesting that maybe it makes sense to play offline some 'deeper strategy games' so as per 'not give out chess pieces freely' narrative ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Twitter comments definitely stink if not because 'internet is read only' && 'boundaries are washed' narrative ... (tbd1,,)

[>] [MARTIAL_ARTS_AND_CRYPTO_TRY_1] ^ When you say that 'crypto should ideally be reduced to mining only' (because the rest is non-methodological/non-systematic ...) and henceforth unable to get to 8-9k$ in the near future ... then 'not abandoning martial arts narrative' continues to occupy central/ultra importance.
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Btw if you're in an 'urgency flipping' mode, in a sense that 'ultra importance' or 'central importance' sounds like to be 'flipped' (in a sense that 'I enjoy rape in prison' wtf wtf) -- then our only friend here is r/MenGetRapedToo which could ground is in a belief or sensation that 'rape in prison' is definitely not enjoyable.

[>] Насчет конзистентности ... вот бывает такое что броузишь этот чат 'DropsEarn.ru' и типа через 5 минут броузинга типа говоришь: 'чзх!?!?!?!' и уходишь из этого чата, как Емельяненко ушел от Джефа Монсона ... так-что консизтентности тут никакой н*х не ожидай - что типа быть 'конзистентным с тестнетами' ... 'если начал -- закончить' ... н*хуя ... 
[@ ^ 1.] Просто по моему лучше тратить это время на 'разрешение поляризаций' они и так бесконечны. 
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ What about 'bonding leverage' then? (for lipton tea)
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ 'Disruptive technologies' && 'people are slowly catching up' -- work in this area, might serve as a 'bonding leverage' aka. give me that 'rite of passage' for 'lipton tea'? (I mean beside mining card  ...)
[@ ^ 1.1.1.1.] ^^ Just f*cking tired of hunting airdrops that are worth 0.4$ in the end. I mean serverously. (?)
[@ ^ 1.1.1.1.1.] ^^ 'Tremble' for 'key portals for reentry' ... crypto is definitely a 'distress states' & 'trauma unresponsiveness' soothener ..
[@ ^ 1.1.1.1.1.1.] ^^ But still, hours of testnets for 0.4$ - oh, mama.
[@ ^ 1.1.1.1.1.1.1.] ^^ What about 'one-cent-a-year' is better than 'zero-cents-a-year' narrative? (?)
[@ ^ 1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.] ^^ Ideally, there's a 'mining&folding card' that earns me 1 cent a year ... then there's a 'vastness of incentivised testnets' which earn you 0.4$ for 2 hours work ... then there's if you're 'able' to 'skip' this 'ocean' of 'testnets' ... again systematic & methodological coding of, m, let's say your competitor to drift on solana (with practice mode) (like another 'alternativeto.net' clone people will 'ape in' still due to a fancy ui) ...
[@ ^ 1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.] ^^ Bla bla can't 'jump over' this 'vastness' ... so far thought of { 'ELO Rating' && 'one-cent-a-year-narrative' } hyper-focus (I'm on a brink of madness, btw)

[>] Значит нарратива 'one-cent-a-year' она помогает мне против 'global existenital gaslighting' ... в плане того что типа если кто-то 'наезжает' на мою простую нарративу { 'Я зарабатываю один цент в год' и это лучше чем зарабатывать '0 центов в год' } -- то тогда он собака проклятая, сволочь которую расстрелять мало. Или по другому все на меня будут срать и нету конца этому (и Я буду хавать и хавать и хавать и превращусь в реального 'DID' without lacking any cohesive singular identity whatsoever in an forever-irrepairable-sense (or 200+ years needed-to-repair sense) (like e.g. yossi balas or someone similar to him)). Но с другой стороны она никого не обижает эта нарратива -- 'Я никого не оскорбляю тем что есть у меня скажем 150 миллионов $ в биткоине анлесс он триангулирован чтобы дошибить конкретно именно меня без всякой на то обоснованной существующей причины' (просто потому что он злостный мститель неизвестно и непонятно за что итп) -- (но даже тут бл*ть есть - заработать 150 миллионов в биткоине - и только потом эирдропить -- то есть н*ххой прижимают и здесь ! (!!!)) -- и видимо по этому (потому что тогда замечаешь кто на*бвается на тебя безо-всякой-на-то-причины фокусируясь на уан-цент-а-йиар-наррайтив) эта нарратива и удерживает меня удерживает от того чтобы вообще сойти окончательно с ума и стать помешанным каким-то челом (несмотря на лысину, зуб, итп.) -- потому что начинаешь тогда замечать 'bad actors' (а так, если ученный безобидный невинный математик -- то вообще не замечаешь) ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ В дополнение - шахматы они важны здесь тоже почему? Потому что какая-то странная вещь происходит -- вот мол Я рассказал папе или виталику про тетрис аттак -- и вдруг ни с того ни ссего Я его начал 'отвергать' и играть мне в него больше не хочется ... так же может произойти и с крипто нарративой '1-цент-в-год лучше чем 0 центов в год' -- что вдруг неподозревая это сам, Я и это вдруг начну 'отвергать' (или что-то тому подобное) и тогда 'накроется' т.е. не будет у меня спасительной сетки 'safety net' от того чтобы совсем окончательно не помешаться рассудком. И это связанно с тем что помня про шахматы ты не забываешь (надеемся) помнить 'что отдавать шахматные фигуры' -- это болит потом дико (через несколько дней) (как было в бейт шахмат когда-то). Чтобы нечаянно ненароком не рассказать а потом пеняй на себя сам типа итп ...

[>] [CRYPTO_HELPS_WITH_PROGRAMMING_1] Also important to note that 'anonymous crypto' in combination with 'one-cent-a-year-narrative' gives a 'price tag' to my programming whereas earlier I needed to 'write a shareware programs' with dubious ('why the f*ck should I even pay for software' debates that I myself had and probably other people would also have) but now, with crypto, the connection between 'indie programming' and 'money' is much more apparent (such as 'write a leverage trading dex' or 'write an splinterlands/brown-dust style rpg game') ... and hence makes it less affectable to various disasters etc. that could potentially 'sweep me off my feet' (in a bad sense of the word) ... be like gnif (https://web.archive.org/web/20221206221837/https://hackaday.com/2017/10/31/10-year-old-bug-crushed-by-hacker-on-a-mission/)

[>] As far as things go right now, airdrop time tracking comes even before writing dtao ... 

[##] When crypto transactions are not possible (and 'grounding' via 'airdrop pomodoro tracking' doesn't work)

[>] ^^ Probably the second best bet is making your own (or improving on) chess/baduk/shogi/xiangqi engine (with the help of chatGPT) ... (and/or pondering about it) ... do you need time tracking there? G-d knows.
[@ ^ 1.] Theoretically speaking, there are always 'subtle' (or 'not-so-subtle') boundaries between males ... and ... with 'ifs', under all 'books' and 'vast trees of theory' - they are 'still to be found' ... which is not to my advantage because when I 'find' those boundaries, I will be probably 'subservient' which might be 'ok' (richard schwartz also needed other therapists at some points) but not 'ideal' (especially if you're locked-in with him for a longer term). (why did I write this? (?)) ... 
[@ ^ 2.] Building chess engine or app from scratch is more important than building an OS from scratch, because of it's relatedness to sporaidic 'tongue slips' which could be rather fatal to us. 

[>] Q. How is chess/go/shogi/xiangqi is ever related to 'ever-existing boundaries between men'?
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ A1: It goes back to 'stages of losing this document' section and realising that the topmost 'not-losing-this-document' is 'maintaining existing ELO rating' in some xyz-area, and not the 'IFS' because you can be as good as some other man in some area of expertise, or else you're lost. Some expert on making money (e.g. some 'serial startup CEO' he's an expert in making money, and if you work as a librarian, then probably you should then focus on 'ELO rating' && 'making money' to compare yourself to a 'top expert' in that field, and hence know from there ... where do you 'dig' next...) ... but if you're not focusing on 'elo-rating' at all then you could end up working as a librarian which kind-of sub-par (if you're even given a free time by the govt, etc.) ...
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ A2.1: Don't know how it's related to the question, but one important property of chess is that an experienced player, can win over a newbie, 5 times in a row with a very high probability. In domino, it's not so.

[>] One idea (probably might not work): Ask the AI to either guide you how to build your own ai step-by-step or to build your own blockchain from scratch 'step-by-step' ...
