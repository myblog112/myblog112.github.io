[#] Public preamble (visible to all,, should there be such one? (?))
[>] Hopefully, this is 'top-level enough' (above hackmd.io, cryptpad, discord, etc.) ... so I'll be able to 'trackback' to it all the time ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Though again some of the information is more private and is currently in 'agenda' doc/excel' ...

[#] Faucets before L1 & L2 (at least one faucet, everything else is 'hypothetical')

[#] L1 & L2's:

[>] ZkSync Testnet 2.0 Ecosystem (Wallet: 0x7a1E...7a1BB (Metamask))
==> List of their testnets: https://matterlabs.notion.site/zkSync-2-0-Testnet-Applications-e38328bccda7472793024a25e26a1cac (it's from their discord) ...
==> Portal: https://portal.zksync.io/,, Governance: couldn't find any (tbd1,,)
==> Governance? (tbd1,,)

[>] StarkNet Testnet Ecosystem (Wallet: 0x016f...07Ee (ArgentX))
==> Working Swap App: https://goerli.10kswap.com/#/

[>] StarkNet MainNet (not testnet) (Alpha)

==> https://young-susanoo.notion.site/Sei-Network-Incentivized-Testnet-Seinami-1f3de71c76c24d4f862af936f0a5fe04
===> Guys only 36 hours left to complete ACT2 testnet in Sei Network. So if anyone interested act fast ...
====> Subm with trio: {disc81 // vovav // KeplrSocialLetters1 }

[>] Aztec

[>] Shardeum

[>] Aptos (already airdropped 150 apt, but they say more opportunities to come ...)

[>] Quai Network (most likely KYC)
==> https://blog.quai.network/quai-network-social-media-rewards-program-39d66a8d935f

[>] Zeta Chain

[>] Sui (not Sei,, mysten labs)
==> https://twitter.com/AirdropsCaptain/status/1559531245352222721

==> https://mobile.twitter.com/OmniFlixNetwork/status/1583156295179214849

[>] Martian Wallet (Probably not doing it b/c it's not a L1/L2, but they are hinting in discord):
==> https://twitter.com/martian_wallet/status/1580959500995301376?s=20&t=VJnUSYWkeBe5dzEpjSOEqw
===> ^^ They suggest to join their discord and look for hints ... anyway ... this is soo out of priority -- try in the next 2-4 weeks ... [2022.10.20] ... otherwise 
you're not adhering to your own 'L1/L2 first rule' and are going to get 'dispersed'/'dissociated'/etc.

Additional Notes:
[>] Master ecosystems excel: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X5RR7WPkLw5V_edosfs6CoYRK1lOsyzRKQZg2oUz7hE/edit#gid=821586093

[>] ```No new task guys? 😁 ==> 
What do u mean? Did u interact with Zksync mainnet? Arb mainnet? Optimism?
I would do them daily, plenty of tokenless protocols there
Besides there is a shit ton of other stuff like all the lens products, lenster/lenstube/phaver to interact with daily
Zerion/slingshot/bungee/orbiter/rabbithole/quest3/layer3 etc a lot of protocols just to name a few
I could write a list that you couldnt finish in a week 🙂 so much to do
