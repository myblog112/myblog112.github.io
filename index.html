Hopefully, this is 'top-level enough' (above hackmd.io, cryptpad, discord, etc.) ... so I'll be able to 'trackback' [<script name="'trackback'">makeQuizElem2('J3RyYWNrYmFjayc=','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] to it all the time ...
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ This is definitely a [<script name="problem">makeQuizElem2('cHJvYmxlbQ==','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>], that is 'shameful' to admit existence of it ... but again, 'fingers in elecric socket' reflex polarisation ...
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ Again, the problem being, that unless I got some ~ 100-200$ usd in crypto -- this document merely becomes a mere 'another document in filesystem' and I have this 'lost in filesystem' syndrome ...
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ You can blame synchronious knockos on this, but it also sometimes feels like this is even above knockos ... e.g. think municipality (city municipality) and/or government level problem ... like. if you 'remove' knockos, somebody else will 99% come in their place

(and also 'the less human factor' -- the more safer the money) ... and so ... before airdrops -- do I have at least 100$ in bitcoin so that this document keeps being remembered?

[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Immigration precisely to ramat aviv was a matter of 'luck' (?)
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ Удержать свою связь с 'рамат авивским' ['immigration precisely to ramat aviv was a matter of luck' - 'Я'] пока находишься в этом микрорайоне (там тоже такое есть но гораздо меньше ощутимо потому что поток русских и иностранных туристов и смешиваешься с ними и не 'singled out' 'waaaaay too obviously' (они ненавидят белых ашкеназов и даже на мусорных ящиках это пишут!! Рядом с бензоколонкой на ул. гиссин ... или х/з какая другая причина ... гомогенная среда которая ненавидит 'чужаков' они все с друг другом на балкончиках сидят и это часть их 'тайтли-книт коммьюнити'/'tightly-knit community' (?)).

[>] Relation of 'crypto bonding leverage' to 'ifs' and 'dangeli' ... ==> is that if you ever talk about ifs anywhere then you're a 'guru' and then you'll have to overpay SteveP 10,000$ ... and in case of 'IFS' will probably not 'overpay to an ifs therapist' but rather ban from an 'ifs therapist' because he will consider you 'too diffucult' a patient and 'will part with you' 'gently' (everything is for sale) ... 
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ And to bond 'talking/not talking' about ifs with thousands of $$$$ ...

[>] The relation between katrain and crypto? ==> Crypto is needed to shut up and not talk on ifs forums because of parallel between 'Pay SteveP 10000$' phenomenon and 'IFS Therapists Landscape Ban' (which would parallely happen if you 'tell everybody how great IFS is' just like as it would with if you told everybody (['sad'] wink,wink ;) !!) how great 'Stephane' is which would lead you to 'The Guru' aka SteveP and it would not be 'cheap' ...)
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ And with crypto the whole 'airdrop farming' shebang is extremely 'noisy' and 'non-linear' and has 'resting day' 'inner conflict' (is it money or not?) aka though it is helpful in extreme states of psyche -- it 'wants' to be 'minimised' and yet it's 'very difficult' to be minimised (probably to 'bitcoin' and 'rvn mining card') and no 'internet' involvement whatsoever ... ==> And chess/go/baduk is also there as a 'tool' to 'shut up' about the same 'stephane' and 'stevep' and 'ifs' ... as in 'don't give out chess pieces' or give a 'minimal possible' chess pieces to be able to survive the later onset of SteveP overwhelm.

[>] What's the relation of 'mom'/'civ' and crypto? ==> Basically the same as the relation between katrain and crypto (see above), but, sometimes, when you feel when you are going to fly to 'Melahim Be-Rotschild' -- playing 'Mom'/'Civ'/'Ufo-Ea' can help you with confidence that you can still study chess/go to a decent level, without needing external help. 

[>] What's the relation between 'tetris attack' and 'crypto'? ==> Basically as with katrain and crypto - there are 2 problems: (1) Crypto is used to 'bond' against talking about IFS which is disasterous to the extent of 'banned by all ifs therapists' yet the 'sleep doctor didn't yet reach his final verdict' (see more detailed explanation in some other doc (this one is a public doc)). (2) Crypto in itself has problems, such as: (2.1.) A conflict with nosurf (aka fills my head with unneccessant twitter noise all the time when I want is a quiet trauma processing with a fiction book). (2.2.) 'Resting day' 'inner conflict' ... (3) (tbd1,,)
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ And when you get banned from all ifs therapists -- obviously the first thing the [inner] critics will say 'what. a. fucking. idiot. have. you. been.' ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ Definition from wikipedia: 'Idiot' was formerly a technical term in legal and psychiatric contexts for some kinds of profound intellectual disability where the mental age is two years or less, and the person cannot guard themself against common physical dangers.
[>>> 1.1.1.1.] ^^ And yet idiots rarely solve puzzles there seems to be an 'inverse' correlation between an 'idiot' aka. 2 year old child who can barely walk ... and someone who is good at solving non-trivial puzzles quickly. ...
[>>> 1.1.1.1.1.] ^^ And somehow, since 'getting banned' from 'ifs therapists landscape' is 'being such an idiot' then maybe playing tetris attack could, sort of, somehow, 'negate' that before that happened (due again to 'inverse correlation' between an idiot and someone who is good at 'solving some non-trivial puzzles for speed') ... by 'spinning' some sort of 'rusty' 'cog' wheel in the head ... that will 'fire' when I'm about to say something 'wrong' to an ifs therapist that I would normally not notice if I woudn't have trained myself to 'solve non-trivial puzzles quickly' at all ... 

[>] Just like there's 'maintaining the same level' of elo with katrain ... there's also maintaing the same level of some sort of 'elo-like rating' with 'tetris attack' ... (e.g. can you solve/spot 10 matches a minute or is it now only being able to spot 1 match only per 10 minutes)? -- so it is kind of a rate-y too ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Also with 'mom'/'civ' there exists elo-like rating (of some sort) (which is not official but you can get a sense when you've 'deteriorated' too much on that 'meta' scale) ...

[>] Definitely reading blockchain [<script name='technologies'>makeQuizElem2('dGVjaG5vbG9naWVz','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] books _all week_ (not just in 'resting day') could help you not drown further into 'ProblemWebSurfing' airdrop farming madness ...

[>] Maybe install & maintain Brown Dust and Langrisser (gather daily diamonds ...) so you'd have something to do at weekend ..
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ After all he even blackmails you with offline games ...

[>] If I'm that strong that people 'sneeze' due to my thoughts, or that smart that I deserve some sort of a nobel prize (or multiple/several nobel prizes), then how come I've not yet got 150 million in bitcoin? (I said that when I got ~ 150 million - then I can airdrop)

[>] Is there '[<script name='untameable/uncontrollable'>makeQuizElem2('dW50YW1lYWJsZS91bmNvbnRyb2xsYWJsZQ==','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] running commentary that just won't stop' lurking there? (?)

[>] Crypto minimalism ==> Ideally, farming should be achieved with a few mining cards. And no involvement with 'web3' whatsoever.

[>] In crypto chats you should 'shut up' even if it might mean that you lose 1000$ ... -- because the whole point (or one major point) of 'bonding leverage' is 
because you lack (lacked) 'self-disciplining' to be able to shut up about other topics such as 'IFS and Stephane and SteveP 10000$ and IFS Therapists Ban' ... and 
if you open yourself up to communication with some possibly angry and 'unreasonable' mod with whom you might be needing to negotiate 'unban' now ... then you 'set 
yourself up' for a 'hole in self disciplining' which you were lacking in the first place and came to 'bonding leverage' just exactly because of that one problem (!!) ...
(re-read this very paragraph from the beginning (maybe a few times (not trying to be 'offending' here))) ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ So the rule of thumb is - to never, ever talk -- even if it loses us 1000-2000$ ...

[>] Don't forget about [<script name='Eckhart Tolle/Hanan Sagiv narrative'>makeQuizElem2('RWNraGFydCBUb2xsZS9IYW5hbiBTYWdpdiBuYXJyYXRpdmU=','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] when you conversing with parents ... or you gonna fall and never find, never find ...

[>] 'Paralyzing Fame Residue'/'Compliments Overwhelm'/'Grandiosity overwhelm' ==> [This is not 100% bulletproof but] ==> Play with { 'still haven't got [<script name='150 million $'>makeQuizElem2('MTUwIG1pbGxpb24gJA==','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] bitcoin if I'm that very smart huh how come' } narrative (and also 'I can airdrop only when I have 150 million $ in bitcoin and I'm short of that sum so far) (?)
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ It works 'better' because basically I could have that sum without anyone on the planet earth knowing (compared to fiat money)...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ 'That was heroism what you did today!' ==> 'But that heroism wasn't enough to get me to [<script name='150 million $'>makeQuizElem2('MTUwIG1pbGxpb24gJA==','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] in bitcoin, wasn't it? (?)' (?) 
[>>> 1.1.1.1.] ^^ That is valid as long as I got [<script name='24h internet connection'>makeQuizElem2('MjRoIGludGVybmV0IGNvbm5lY3Rpb24=','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] & some [<script name='privacy'>makeQuizElem2('cHJpdmFjeQ==','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>].

[>] What's the relation of 'knocking neighbors' to 'redpill/mra' videos? ==> 'Government-backed [<script name='feminism nonsense'>makeQuizElem2('ZmVtaW5pc20gbm9uc2Vuc2U=','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] overwhelm' vs. 'dick existence' polarisation ...

[>] { 'Government-backed feminism nonsense overwhelm' vs. 'dick existence' } polarisation needs to be fed 'context' ... both the 'cults' context (because r/datingoverfifty is super-hellish) ... also the mra context (medusa wives existence && you are not alone/isolated/ostracised by govt. backed feminsim nonsense overwhelm && how they cope with it) ... 
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ And maybe also cptsd/ifs/did/academically-backed trauma context ('fantastic beasts and where to find them') (you know about Jay Wacker).
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ This can definitely [<script name='impede'>makeQuizElem2('aW1wZWRl','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] getting outside as you meet eyes with pumped-up Fatma's you just lose all hyper-focus there ever ever ever was ... and most certainly get 'lost' on the way ('how a 'skirt' can make a man 'trip') ...
[>>> 1.1.1.1.] ^^ This just puts them from 'a walking angel'/'i saw an angel' state into some more 'neutral' 'balanced' light (e.g. such as what I got from r/femaledatingstrategy: 'she's going to check the baldness of her future bf's father' etc.) ... and hopefully give you more 'rite of passage' ...
[>>> 1.1.1.1.1.] ^^ There's also some 'dark' sh*t to process like 'I don't fit into the gaussian' and 'Aurelia Brouwers' (if I try to expand on this here --> it really 'dark' sh*t trust me ...) ...

[>] Please be gentle with yourself in a sense that before I found out about no-bad-parts frame, I have been rebelling against my own parts .. after listening to owen cook in a sense that I've learned that I've been 'projecting my ego' onto other people and now I'm not ... I'm above that filthy, despicable low-life level!
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ In a sense that when a 'saving grace' voice appeared -- I've been f*cking rebelling against it instead of asking it protector questions ... so I've done a bunch of stupid things, many of whom might take beyond lifetime (not enough vitality, etc.) to unburden ...

[>] The narrative/motive of 'copycat studying' of 'bjj & chin-na' (copycat I mean via palpating their's books, not youtubs) -- for the sake of 'limits problem' -- never went away nowhere ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ With bjj alone you're still in 'fog' in a sense that 'how do you get him to the ground'? So you need chin-na copycatting too ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ And one important takeaway from this is it although you've lost ~60-70% of do-kwon's money ... it's still important to somehow manage not losing the last 100$ in crypto or else this very document ... I won't be able to navigate to ... and will be [<script name='[lost in filesystem]'>makeQuizElem2('ZmlsZXN5c3RlbQ==','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] forever again.
[>>> 1.1.1.1.1] ^^ So from that I suppose - we must infer our 'testnets' and 'airdrops' participation ... (this 'promised airdrop' 'instability'/'jitteredness' unfortunately still remains ...) as I'm still stuck in petah tikva endless maze.

[>] ^^ So how about 'stay the same elo-like rating' with 'bjj & chin-na' and don't 'deteriorate'?
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Always, always try to [<script name='backtrack'>makeQuizElem2('YmFja3RyYWNr','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] back to 'maintaining the same elo' with katrain/mom/civ/tetris-attack if/when tolerable/possible because amnesia left-and-right ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ So there's a lot of ifs protector clusterf*ckia involved here ... (tbd1,,)
[>>> 1.1.1.1.] ^^ First thing there's [<script name='amnesia'>makeQuizElem2('YW1uZXNpYQ==','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] (dementia? (?)) episodes when I 'jump' straight onto bjj youtube vids (even under theembodimentconference.org) 

[>] ^^ So, if we're talking about 'maintaining existing elo levels' - then are there 'elo levels' of: Foreign & Spoken languages knowledge? Of Guitar & Piano knowledge/skill? Of Drawing? Of Tai-chi? Of Programming? Rpg story/journey games? ==> Moved to separate section ...
``` TODELETE
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ If something goes wrong (it did happen once - with 'ifs elo') -- go back / retract to 'maintaining the same elo level with katrain' - it still works ...
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Drawing - probably not (as there is very little 'competition context') ...
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ We need/want that for 'bjj & chin-na' spindown as seemingly just katrain/mom/civ/tetris-attack just don't seem to 'cut' it on their own alone-wise ...
[@ ^ 3.] ^^ It seems that tai-chi (aka. 'martial arts meditation' (as opposed to yoga, which is a 'postures' meditation)) is a 'part of' maintaining same elo level with 'bjj&chin-na'? E.g. 'do at least some 'farthest resemblance' movement? (?) (?) (?)
[@ ^ 3.1.] ^^ Or maybe I'm wrong? (?) (?) (?)
[@ ^ 3.1.1.] ^^ There's no 'maintaining the same elo level with tai-chi kata' because tai-chi is the actually one from which the whole idea of 'keeping _at least_ the same elo level with katrain' hyper-focus came from ... in a sense that it says ... 'at least don't lose martial arts at all if you have bjj painful fracture ... because martial arts are _so_, _so_ important' and 'probably self-rehearsed 'mostly theoretical only' chin-na is better than no chin-na knowledge altogether, even theoretical' from that 'at least don't lose martial arts entirely' probably came the understanding: 'don't lose katrain entirely' ... ==> so supposedly copy-catting chin-na as per jwing ming's books & dvd's (you have both, also for martial applications of it) supposed to 'keep' that 'elo' 'hyper-focus' ==> So I suppose what it should be is: 'copy-catting chin-na and it's martial applications as perfectly as possible' and the best you can make of it ==> Try 'trembling' for it ... who knows ... ==> tbd1,,
[@ ^ 4.] ^^ Is there 'maintaining the same ELO' with ifs? ==> Seems like not so it means that ifs is a 'bottomless pit' yet in some certain situational overwhelm situations it is very useful... and there are a lot of overwhelming situational situations in certain specific GPS locations ... ==> tbd1,,
[@ ^ 4.1.] ^^ Also: ifs is not a bottomless pit in a sense that if a specific individual is in some cult (or jumping between cults) ... then ifs provides an 'academically-refined' cult which is a 'less' 'bottomless pit' than some other 'cults' that exist out there ... due to 'academia-peer-review' property of it ...,, but still tbd1
[@ ^ 4.1.1.] ^^ So in a sense ifs is not a 'bottomless pit' but rather is a 'lesser' 'bottomless pit' which is good for segments of population who reside in a 'bottomless pit' (e.g. cults followers who do not realise and/or blackout within them, the harmful effects of their cults)...
[@ ^ 6.] ^^ Is there 'elo level' regarding 'digital minimalism' and 'extreme privacy' (a.k.a. michael bezzel? (?)) ==> Apparently can't touch that because moving to ramat aviv is on a 'higher note' than 'worrying about extreme privacy' because if I'm not 'careful' then the whole shebang of being near 'internet' & 'privacy' could be 'taken away' from me ... so it's secondary unfortunately (and things will inevitably 'spill' the painful ones which shouldn't ...)
[@ ^ 6.1.]
[@ ^ 7.] ^^ Just curious - is there 'elo level' with bridge? ==> Well yep if you sit 3h bridge marathon with Oren Lidor and/or Doron Yadlin -- you will either score less or score more or equal -- and that determines your elo level compared to them ... 
[@ ^ 7.1.] ^^ This elo level is rather 'sparse' compared to chess e.g. statistical-rather but in overall sense if you run 10-days marathon against one of them ... then their { (1) Memorisation of bidding language. (2) Knowledge to recognise of signals when playing hand. (3) A little bit of algorighmic thinking of how to play and what not to play depending on what partners played (but this algorithmic thinking is much less 'deep' than chess) (4) ? } ==> will to a large extent determine whether they win or a lose in points in that 10 days marathon. But then again, this is not a 'measure' of anything ... e.g. their algorithmic thinking might be more 'mediocre' than a chess player ... their 'language of bidding' knowledge -- might be due to them having inherited that from their rich parents from childhood ... just like french was a language of 'high circles' in some non-french societies ... but again the purpose of this is mostly about not the 'elo' but rather having some sort of alternate venue of connecting with people / making connections with people ... but then again ... this is not the sole way of making connections ... and it's possible that existence of interconnected internet has made this 'bridge' lucrativity even more obsolete ... as one could simply invest in making an arbitrage bot and blow all the bridge people out of the water ... I mean in a sense that 'bridge' was some sort of 'gamble-pointing of a finger' when you were out of options ... and so you saw e.g. some ad in tel-aviv university sports club and thought: ha! this must be it! ... but it is very possible that for example working with parts and interrogating them with protector questions ... in retrospect ... wouldn't bring you to any 'bridge' seeking altogether. E.g. in a sense of: nothing's broke -- don't apply any sort of 'band-aid' on top of it ... it's like more like carrying some notion of 'if it's all so seemingly 'too calm'' then 'add even more overwhelm on top of it' -- 'and then it all will become clear!' sort of mindset .. which might in retrospect not overwhelm -- the already overwhelmed & mega-traumatised system.
[@ ^ 7.1.1.] ^^ When nobody talks ... there's not to 'bring yourself to people' to cause additional overwhelm on the system, that might in fact, be traumatised and needed more of that ramat aviv immersion ...

[@ ^ 8.1.] ^^ Blockchain & Crypto Technology books are probably '>' (bigger) in that domain-or-realm, than 'airdrop farming' ... (considering that plain 'indie-crypto lifetime narrative' is 'overwhelm' ...) 
[@ ^ 8.1.1.] ^^ In a sense that 'dry studying' of that technology somehow helps more than just plain farming/sybilling (although counter-intuitive (wtf does studying even help?!?!? (?)))) ...
[@ ^ 8.2.] ^^ Reading a substantial chunk of crypto-technology-or-blockchain-technology [<script name='book'>makeQuizElem2('Ym9vaw==','&lt;pomflh&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] before doing any faucets and/or airdrops? (?) (in a sense of 'which is higher elo level?' - wise)) -- you have staking already ... so ... 
[@ ^ 8.2.1.] ^^ What I'm trying to get to - is to do only minimalist super-obvious airdrop farming ... and like 2-3 precalculated steps (didn't need to jerky-signup for neither ampleforth, nor optimism, nor stargaze, nor evmos, nor aptos, nor paraswap, nor cowswap, etc.) ... jerky-signups definitely f*cks me up. And a 'book' before faucets could get me into an appropriate mood before jumping onto twitter? (?)
[@ ^ 9.] ^^ Is there such a thing as a 'dating elo rating' (as in r/datingoverfifty)? Or lack-of-dating-thereof elo-rating? In a sense that, m, it could be probably related to why ''indie-crypto lifetime narrative' elo rating' is an overwhelm, compared to 'cryptocurrency elo rating' ... ? (?) (?) (?)
[@ ^ 9.1.] ^^ Maybe it's just 'living around women' elo (without involving any sort of 'dating' or 'datingoverfifty' or 'lack-of-dating',, yet ...)
[@ ^ 10.] ^^ Is there ''indie-crypto lifetime narrative' elo rating' (aka. 'elo rating' pertaining to 'indie-crypto narrative') 
[@ ^ 10.1.] ^^ That is seemingly unfortunately is 'overwhelm' of some 'unknown kind' (when you had 8-9k$ - this was not an overwhelm) so unfortunately go back to 'cryptocurency elo rating' and dwell there? (?)

(х/з может потому что там все-еще возможна работа близкая к программированию (каким-то е*нным макаром х/з хотя может и эмбодимент там тоже скоро 'исчезнет' мы не можем этого знать ...) ... и (2) ты не знаешь -- когда (если вообще) ты сможешь в следующий раз туда приехать/доехать (вот так вот ...)

[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Point being, that if you have the 100$ money -- don't f*cking lose it ... do your utmost to not lose it. Money makes things easier. Whatever sh*t I'm in (or 'in for' ...)

[>] ^^ How I came to this section? [Try & Maintain existing] 'Katrain elo rating' (when lost & neurotic & cannot find yourself amidst 'floating in pink'/'pink brain'/'preagnant brain' .. ) ==> 'IFS elo rating' ==> 'Cults elo rating' (which is the same as 'ifs elo rating', right?) ==> 'Tai-chi/Martial Arts elo rating' ==> (resting day) ==> 'Bridge elo rating' ==> 'Cryptocurrency elo rating' ==> 'Indie-crypto elo rating' ==> '[Living with potenitally hostile] Women elo rating' ==> (When thinking of '[living with potentially hostile] women elo rating' then it f*cking backtracks to the 'hah, prove yourself!' aka 'the real katrain elo rating maintenance-of' ...

[>] One point of note, is, that 'boundaries between men' always exist, even on the topmost levels (e.g. 2 topmost competing presidents) so when really lost ... then you're really lost ... ==> This is less important ... the narrative is more about 'chess/baduk' helping me within nadine's group and henceforth ==> maintaining at least the same elo with katrain ... this way it's less 'sharp' in 'extreme states' (tbd1,,)

[@ ^ 5.] [WRITING_OWN_BADUK_KATAGO_LIKE_ENGINE_1] Writing own katago-like engine ==> and publishing it on github ... from scratch ... -- might borderline-help me study baduk as a-by-process and maintain my 'elo' at somewhat 'decent' level otherwise I just would not be able to write a decent engine.

[@ ^ 15.] [TALKING_ABOUT_KATRAIN_1] ^^ Telling to others about katrain might f*ck up your katrain elo rating, just like it did with chess ...
[@ ^ 15.1.] ^^ Sometimes getting outside of the 'feminism nonsense domination realm' (aka. home) into other gps locations could help, but needs self-organisation abilities like throw over-accumulated garbage, which, just doesn't happen.

[>] Is there something you want me to [<script name='know'>makeQuizElem2('a25vdw==','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>]?

Beta:
[>] Are you willing to look me in the eyes?
[>] Would you like to palpate me via 'groping', like a blindfolded person would?
[>] What are you holding for me? (Что ты для меня держишь?)
[>] Give it time to check you out and get to know you. (Дайте время на то, чтобы он смог [<script name='оценить'>makeQuizElem2('0L7RhtC10L3QuNGC0Yw=','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] и узнать вас.)

[>] Ask it, “What is it like to meet me?” (Спросите: «Каково это встретиться со мной?»)

Other-Beta (tbd1,,):
* What is this protector trying to protect me from?
* What does this protector believe about the situation or about me?
* What does this protector want me to do or not do?
* How does this protector make me feel?
* How does this protector help me or hurt me?

[Less frequent]:

[>] Programming for 'bonding leverage' might not exactly work, because it would take ~ 20 years for it to turn to a 'bonding leverage' and I don't have that f*cking time ...

[>] Drawing nft's for 'bonding leverage' might also not exactly work because it is 'creative' job and will raise 'demonic emotions' ... probably won't work in distress states ...

[##] Preamble 6 - Bridge and ChatGPT (tbd1,,)

---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ----
[##] Preamble 28 - Q. Bridge And Geography (aka. Bridge 3h punishment and geography / topography ...)

[>] ^^ I have this suspicion, that, bridge 3h punishment is somehow directly correlated to population density line (e.g. p-t -- r-g -- lamed & r-a) ... in a sense that the 'lesser' you can sense the difference between 'prison' and 'freedom' ... -- the more you need that bridge 3h punishment ... to keep yourelf 'in line' ... 

[>] ^^ Also, related: In regard to that 'overwhelming' 'crypto-crypto' voice ... -- is the need for 'holding onto my crypto', as, the need for '3h bridge punishment', -- spacial? In a sense that, in petah tikva I'd need extremely bridge 3h punishment (due to { lack of prison vs. freedom discernance } combined with { the need for self-disciplining and self-accountability} ?) yet in ramat-gan--near-bney-brak I'd need 'less of' 3h bridge punishment to get by ... and in 'shikun lamed and ramat aviv' I'd need even less of 'bridge 3h punishment'? I'm saying that because, bridge 3h punishment makes me wanna teach myself to smoke, and I'm almost puking when I'm peeing (def. a serious health problems down the road ...)
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ So maybe duplicate (with slight changes) what I'll write here -- into 'crypto-crypto' section ...

[>] ^^ Basically I tried to 'downgrade' to 'IFS teacher' and 'Geography' but sometimes I still can't 'palpate' that and just say in frustration: what the f*ck is this f*ckaristry and 'rollback' to 'bridge 3h and geography' (whatever the health and/or tooth loss cost) (coz I just can't feel the f*cking bottom and that infuriates beyond imaginable) ...

[>] ^^ Strategy: Print dtao page and 'metuculously lick' ('вылизывание всех плинтусов') the ... notes in dtao boxes and get rid of the 'todisp' papers including dtao 'checked boxes already' papers ...
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Also Strategy: Draw on 'todisp' paper, the tasks from previous on-the-road dtao (in a 'creative' way ... also 'distress-ground' with a drawing book ...)

[>] ^^ Strategy: write any semi-useful software definitely helps with 'geography changes' ... remember when you were walking once, doing your chores in petah-tikva after 'studying tai-chi kata' (!!) -- things flew effortlessly! But try, even if you're doing a 'shitstorm' project like crypto game, to not publish or talk about it with anyone, until it's 99.9% complete (you can even buy website on vultr!! (and make a real website before you brag)) ... due to { 'cohesive' 'singular' identity' ==> 'cohesive' <insert sw project name here> 'identity' } && { talking about topics strictly related to chess } (the idea being, that in petah tikva, or with my health state -- you probably will never reach that 99.9% of completeness, because there are like ton of non-shitstorm, projects that will take beyond lifetime to write and they should be given a priority (b/c 'disruptive technologies' && 'people are 'catching up' ... ' ...) ... and theoretically those startup-ish type projects never should/would (aka. within my lifetime) reach 99.9% 

---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ----
[##] Preamble 5 - Bridge and Cults (without cults bridge wouldn't come to be now would it? (?))

[>] Some related note: you had some whatever life disaster (dudaev, et al.) and then you've found SteveP's cult and then later you've found 'Owen Cook's cult ... and then ... you've said, ok, bridge is anti-cult ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ But it still has a problem due to it's '3h punishment' for 'oren lidor's rejection' shuts off any chance for a real punishment ... you're already on 'overdrive' (not even 'self punishing' but even 'self-poisoning!') ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ This above came from 'katrain' and 'ifs' e.g. see above on the topic of 'if there's 'maintaining the same elo with katrain/mom/civ/tetris-attack' then is there 'maintaining the same elo' with 'tai-chi' and is there 'maintaining the same elo' with 'ifs'?

[#] Misc Notes - What comes after 'print 5+5' 

[>] So basically you're writing on paper your thoughts, and then there's a voice: 'write 'print 5+5'' ... so what do I do then? And does it really matter?
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Again, in a sense, it looks like the right direction here is to get tho fock out of the house due to 'r/MenGetRapedToo' dynamic that is definitely manifesting here ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ But let's say that you can't get outside due to some unforseen circumstance (something in the house needs to be fixed urgently or you're waiting urgently for someone, or there's some unforseen other circumstance e.g. you were in distress ... so you started writing your thougths on paper ... then a thought 'write me 'print 5+5' came', but when now you think about getting out -- the distress aren't 'gone' ... you're still in 'write thoughts on paper mode' and 'stuckness' whom you're trying to write onto paper - says: nope, not getting out!' ... -- so what do you do then? (In a sense of a 'print 5+5' thought?)
[>>> 1.1.1.1.] ^^ Because such situations did occur more than once to me.

[@ ^ 1.] ^^ So how do I 'continue' on that 'print 5+5' narrative? Let's say after few 'print 5+5''s in python repl prompt, you would next would want to probably write homebrew/weekend projects 'whatever you feel like' because 'disruptive technologies' and 'people are slowly 'catching up'' (aka. 'I'm having a fridge but everyone else have to go to the store and buy ice cubes' analogy) 
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ And henceforth it's important to rely on 'whatever you feel like' intuition because you innately feel where people might be 'slowly catching up'
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ Minecraft sign 32 bit is also a 'disruptive technology' and 'people are slowly catching up'

[@ ^ 2.] ^^ Next, you go into lesser-shitstorm indie crypto projects one of such would be a 'gmx.io' fork, that would allow for leverage trading practice mode, and would stop you from at least 'investing money into sh*tcoins' and _keep_ that 100$ in bitcoin for the sake of that document ...
[@ ^ 2.1.] ^^ Maybe also get into arbitrage bots ...
[@ ^ 2.2.] ^^ Also nano burn script might, m, be one of 'lesser-shitstorm' indie crypto projects (where is their medium doc)?
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Where 'homebrew' is not enough -- pummel them with 'crypto $$$$' ...

[@ ^ 3.] ^^ Worst case you go onto 'more shitstormish' indie crypt projects such as your own governatic chain, your own brown dust clone, tbd1,,
[@ ^ 3.1.] ^^ Your own decentralised datahoarder-services-for-money marketplace ... (?),, your own memrise clone for 'nft's',, your own 'Decentralised Coin Storage' minimalist PoW blockchain ...,,
[@ ^ 3.1.] ^^ But that still is imo better then dancing around for amberdao.io liquidity ... and ...
[@ ^ 3.2.] ^^ DCS (Decentralised Coin Storage) PoW coin (which allows non-native coins, but doesn't allow swaps, etc.)

[@ ^ 4.] ^^ Sw Projects around IFS -- forum, memrise clone (for ifs studying),,

[@ ^ 5.] ^^ Last but not least - you want to do 'dip' into father and/or michael excercise, just because conversations with them might be inevitable, and you want to have some 'safety-net' to resort to (regardless of legal/cult-mind-control/favoxil issues that I might or might not be able to resolve) ...

Onwards, Onto the finer detail (there are more finer subdivisions of 'homebrew', such as 'making order in filesystem' (in super-distress states)):

[@ ^ 1.] First of all you have to address the 'r/MenGetRapedToo' dynamic that is in the appartment building (otherwise you will get into 'paralyzis by analysis' mode without understanding what is going on ...
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ The subreddit has a list of books ... but the obvious first book is aflsd aka. 'Innocence Project' book and only then comes the 'Anatomy of Female Power' (?)
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ Secondly you have to somehow address the 'r/nofap' dynamic (because most likely you are sitting near the computer right now)
[@ ^ 1.1.1.1.] Also, you have to somehow address the 'r/datingoverfifty' dynamic ... 

[@ ^ 2.] ^^ Secondly you have to somehow address the 'r/nofap' dynamic (because most likely you are sitting near the computer right now)
[@ ^ 2.1.] ^^ 'Games complexity' & 'Shogi/Xiangqi' books right thereafter. Don't ask.

[@ ^ 3.] ^^ 'Human Depth Games complexity' books (don't ask) (see above).

[@ ^ 4.] Nosurf books.

[@ ^ 5.] Blockchain technologies books (first, second, and third reading is without any experiments, just read (for the sake of 'explosiveness'))

[@ ^ 6.] r/MenGetRapedToo - Chapter 2 ==> The 'what ifs cornered' states ... (where 'nothing works' aka even having done the tai-chi -- you cannot hyper-focus on j*ck sh*t)
[@ ^ 6.1.] ^^ Any 'female power' books you can find (not to 'debate' with women their 'female power' but to guide yourself (hopefully) out of that 'what-ifs-cornered' state) ...
[@ ^ 6.1.1.] ^^ Again, academic books on female power are probably more preferable because they are 'deeper' but also 'cults books' (because non-academic books sometimes get you into other 'sh*thole's).

[@ ^ 7.] Cults books (if reading 'female power' books for some other reason mentioned above).

[@ ^ 8.] Extreme Privacy && Identity Theft books (afraid of 'computer security' abyss)

[@ ^ 9.] ^^ How to pass exams books (studying chess is 'reading book' + 'puzzles'/'katrain' but then this also starts feeling relevant ...) 

tbd1,,

[@ ^ 4.] Poverty finance books (david ramsey?)

[@ ^ 8.] ^^ IFS Certification books help me talk to myself more coherently without being ashamed.
[@ ^ 8.1.] ^^ But 'voices' tell me that something should come 'before' those 'ifs books' ... (is it 'programming career' books?)

[@ ^ 3.] 'Daytrading and leverage trading'

[>] [INDIE_CRYPTO_NARRATIVE_1] 'Indie crypto narrative' for 'bonding leverage' for 'lipton tea' is always preferable to 'airdrop farming' for that same leverage ... you have staking coins and beyond that there are 2-3 significant airdrops per year -- jerkiness-hunting for last-minute opportunities is very very hazardous. If they pressure you with time - super hazardous.
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Not being afraid of [missing] some earning opportunities that end in two weeks if you don't 'hurry hurry hurry' ... you have staking coins.

[>] [INDIE_CRYPTO_NARRATIVE_1] Indie-crypto lifetime narrative (micro-steps / incremental-micro-pilots) is better for trauma regulation then 'airdrop beggarship' narrative, because when you're a 'loser' and 'neighbors knock' then 'indie crypto narrative' 'survives' better then 'f*ck it no more airdrops' narrative (in that sense I mean ...) 
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ But again, it's not as 'palpatable' as 'almost-feels-like-real money' which is in 'airdrop hunter' narrative ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ This doc, for one, wouldn't be as 'findable' if not for 'airdrop farming' or '1 cent a year' narrative ...

[>] [COMPLETION_STATUS_COLUMN_1] 2-3 major airdrops per year ... типа когда-то ты понимаешь что по статистике когда ты заработал 1k$-2k$-3k$ то когда тебе раз-в-год прийдет _может быть_ eще 1k$-2k$ (и/или с _большой_ редкостью - 4k$-20k$ -- что нехрена не обещанно и можно так 10 лет прождать и нехера такого больше не будет никогда) то типа понимаешь -- что время которое ты вкладываешь в это - оно становится все более и более бессмысленно и не стоит того - стоит просто сидеть как йог и медитировать -- и психику и так уже досконально до невозможности фрагментированную - не нарушать (хотя-бы этими дерганиями-идиотствами). Вообщем что Я хочу -- чтобы скажем выбрать 'нашумевший' пройект скажем какой-то L1 ... и обозначать ему 'комплетенесс-статус' типа вот типа Я сделал здесь 10 транзакций в течение 3-4 недель на одном кошельке -- заминтил нфт -- проголосовал за один говернанс пропозал -- может зделал гиткоин донейшн -- дискорд привязал к этому аккаунту -- и в основном теперь там комплишн статус он примерно 80% и вообще его больше не трогаем нахуй. Дропнет-дропнет ... не дропнет-не дропнет. Типа писать колоночку: комплишн статус.

[>] [EVMOS_STAKING_1] Evmos staking is only there to have 1$/week to invest into top-ten hinted/confirmed token projects. But don't expect from it astronomic returns. Otherwise it's trading. We are de-facto counting on $EVMOS not to go below 0.7$ (like polygon/matic, which is also a evm) (which is based on speculation) ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Beyond that ... we don't 'invest' into evmos. For like 1000$/month returns we know it's sh*t. Should evmos die/go below 0.7$ then probably find some other 100% blockchain and/or even if we could accumulate a big sum till then (e.g. 1000$ just invest it into some 20% cosmos token or other L1 token (not a protocol))

[>] Q. Daytrading bitcoin: Bitcoin is probably the safest place to store airdropped & mined $$$ (due to 'less rugpullable smart contracts possbilities' and 'less human factor') but still is not the 'main unit of account' ... in a sense that you can ask 'how do you know that bitcoin doesn't go down now to 200$ per bitcoin?' when daytrading bitcoin, but you can't ask the inverse about usdc-to-bitcoin ratio when daytrading usdc. Like 'how do you know that usdc doesn't go now to 0.0000,000,0001 of $BTC from now's 0.0001 $BTC?'

[#] Misc Notes - Daytrading and Leverage Trading

[>] Q. Why do you need 150 million $?
[@ ^ 1.] A1: To be able to 'bond' for buying lipton tea, gathering crates, harmful substances consumption (or 'frictioning' such a consumption) ... 
[@ ^ 2.] A1.1.: ^^ In regard to 'bonding $$$' for 'gathering crates' ==> Immigration to ramat aviv was a matter of luck.

[>] You're going to lose access to this document again (b/c lose 100$ btc via amplified 100x loss factor) ...

[>] ^^ Remember you can't invest into crypto from outside sources!!! Daytrading you get 'liquidated' and then again 'liquidated' and then again you'll invest the last 100$ from bitcoin into there ... and then what? This document then becomes an ordinary document in filesystem again!

[>] [ANATOLYS_MORTAGE_DUE_1] ^^ Anatoly Yakovenko may have some mortage payouts left ... so he'll sporaidically sell at random times to not be 'too visible' but you ... are thinking ... wow, exciting technology ... so undervalued! Wtf -- ... and yakovenko ... ok ... I need here some mortage to pay ... hmm.

[>] ^^ You'll last longer (I understand that sometimes you don't want that, but in a good sense ...) if you just keep investing 3$/week for airdrops lottery.
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ You depend on every piece of crypto (even $200 is good. $400 is better. $800 is even better. 10x losses are terrifying.)

[>] [GAMBLER_BIAS_1] The reason leverage trading probably won't work in the longer term -- is because of 'human psychology' aka. the 'gambler bias' ('I'm always right! I can't be wrong! Just look at all the successful trades I've made in the past!... I just can't be wrong! ==> Invest more. ==> There's no 'lower bound' to the money you can and will invest. Or is there?).

[>] [NO_LOWER_BOUND_1] No lower bound (aka. where do you stop your losses)? At $100 loss? At $200 loss? Every $ in crypto is an important bonding leverage.

[>] [EXTREME_DEMENTIA_1] Secrert-Crypto is more like for the case that when you 'lost your hanging rope in some closet' 'forgot where you shoved it' ... and 'cannot find ... cannot find ...' ... and ..
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ At least do some over-the-days planning of how much exactly you want to invest, and/or where are you exactly stopping ... or else ... просто откалываться будет этот кусочек с 'дименцией' и просто вещи будут 'вылетать' из головы налево и направо 'куда же Я сунул эту веревку ...' (I cannot, m, even here say, m, that the fear of 'extreme dementia' fear -- will be 'enough' -- to self-discipline myself.
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ Even after you've invested in perps -- document everything! Documenting everything helps 'cut losses' or at least so my and 'Groovy Guy''s hunch says ...

[>] One way to stop losses is to 'not lose martial arts narrative' entirely ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ I think that airdrops are enough to maintain $100 for this document (at least for next few years, after aptos airdrop). Do not go deeper.

[>] [SURVIVORSHIP_BIAS_PROFESSOR_COIN_1] "I had a professor who had the class stand up and all start flipping coins. If you flipped tails you sat down and stopped. After several iterations he interviewed the last remaining standing person to ask him what hard work he did to become such a good coin flipper, and if he had any secrets about coin flipping success he wanted to share with the class. It was a pretty nice exercise and I think applicable generally to the hero-worship that often surrounds successful people." <==> This doesn't apply to 'leverage trading' specifically -- but to any trading ...
 
[>] It's not the 'sound science' behind it ... it's the 'addiction' behind it ...

[>] [BEYOND_SELF_DISCIPLINING_AND_LEVERAGE_TRADING_1] Q. How exactly in certain specific GPS locations, where I'm 'beyond self disciplining' do I prevent myself from deteriorating into/onto 'leverage trading' and losing access to this very document (because now 100$ in btc is then will be also gone)? After all, if I can't sense the difference between 'prison' and 'freedom', I cannot say 'bla bla if you leverage trade, you'll go to prison!' to mysel (because, again, like, f*ck! I _enjoy_ prison! ...) ...?
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ So, umm, how exactly do I prevent myself from deteriorating into leverage trading, in gps locations where I'm 'beyond self-disciplining'? (?)

[>] [INCAPABLE_OF_ACCEPTING_THE_LOSS__SYNDROME_1] ^^ You are incapable of 'accepting the loss' -- like you were incapable with fire emblem heroes (!!) -- now think trading or 'leverage trading' (!!)

[>] Mining card still brings me 48$/year -- so that one alone could cover completely the bitcoin 100$ -- no need for leverage trading of any kind ...

[>] [2022.11.16 10:25] Duh, still invested into solana in the morning ==> 500$ (does the 'entry' price matter? ==> probably not. ==> 14.46$) ==> So now it's 491$
[@ ^ 1.] ^ Eventually, even now I believe that sooner or later it will come back to it's original price (within a day or two, with ~ 90% probability) but the problem is, that during all that 'anticipation' time ... I will be in 'trainwrecked' non-calm neurosis-resembling state. Which I don't ever, ever, ever ever need. In my already, m, almost 'silkom' situation ... 
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ Now the 'brave' thing, is to 'accept the loss, and sell in this very minute, right?' (?)
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] [2022.11.16 10:57] ^^ Want to cut the losses now, to be able not to lose access to this document ...
[@ ^ 1.1.1.1.] ^^ Playing brown dust, langrisser, and worst case skyweaver are less likely than trading to make me 'lose' this document ... than jup.ag and/or gmx.io ...
[@ ^ 1.1.1.1.1.] ^^ Nah, still couldn't sell back (it's 14.18 now) ==> So trying to come up with 'distorted perceptions & interative probabilistic reasoning' (?) ==> Nothing else comes into my mind right now, sorry ('mind stuckness') 

[>] [MURPHYS_LAW_YAKOVENKO_LAMBO_1] Помнишь закон мэрфи -- как только ты купил - точь-в-точь в тот момент у анатолия яковенко ломается машина его ламборгини и ему срочно нужно на заменительный компонент ...

[>] Then you'll spend the rest of the day glued to the laptop, unable to move, whilst being cheerleaded by knockors.

[>] Начинай на себя орать: (иногда анстайфлинг здесь да помогает в таких экстремальных случаях) -- что типа мол *** с*бака ты пр*ебешь мне ламборгини опять! Опять занимаешься трэйдингом ск*тина проклятая сейчас яковенко тебе дампнет прямо сейчас а ты сс*** такаоя сякоя!

[>] Polarization: One part wants to have 8k$ or 20k$ -- but the other part says 'no' to leverage trading ==> ?

[>] Когда очень страшно становится - тогда вспоминаем [труизм] что нас будут любым раскладом в конце есть червячки под землей... и тогда становится менее страшно ...
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Но это все при условии что очень сильно если 'вышибает' то начинаешь думать что эээ эти червячки это тоже квантовые молекулы и это все переход в другой мир итп ... и тогда смотреть документальные фильмы подкасты и автобиографии читать и книги по [культам/сектам] (и надеяться что так 'откатит' ...) (что типа изучай культы чтобы сам у себя заметить может ты в каком-то культе итп ...) ...
[@ ^ 1.1.] В любом случае ... вероятнее всего в состояниях 'превыше' червячков - какая - мы в традиции академически-поддержаного ifs -- не хотим такие состояния 'обрезать' и 'репрессировать' (наподобе 'no bad parts' and hence if it by any chance is still one of my repressed parts ... somehow twistedly trying to bring to attention or something) just somehow be 'gentle' or 'gentler' with it, via e.g. doing some distracting activity such as watching 'cults' documentaries and podcasts ... until (or if) I could arrive back to reading a cult 'book' ... (at least for now that's my opinion on how those states 'beyond white worms' should be, umm, best related to ...) ...
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ Again the backing idea behind watching cults videos for 'beyond white worms' states -- is ... --- that such states could potentially set you up for 'signing an infinite year contract with scientology's sea org' ... 'and then after 35 years come out bashing the, umm, david miscavige' which would be 'more bad than good' ... as simply as that ... 'more bad than good' rather than 'more good than bad' aka 'not the least bad option' or 'not the least bad 'trajectory'' ... (?) (tbd1,,)

[>] Иногда спрашиваешь себя - зачем меня родители родили на этот свет а потом отреклись? Зачем? Зачем? Зачем?!?!?! ==> No bad parts. Some parts are reproductive parts. Those are also parts and henceforth are not bad. They were 'sad' so they 'found each other' saga ... ==> They they again became 'sad and lonely' and asked heavens for help ... and heavens brought them a child. 

[>] [ZYGOMATIC_IS_AN_UNFORGIVABLE_MISTAKE_1] No wonders (or billions) in the world will redeem the vastness of the 'loss of [<script name="photogenic face">makeQuizElem2('cGhvdG9nZW5pYyBmYWNl', '&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>]' mistake ... it's an 'остров' movie style grade mistake ... no doctor will fix it // no doctor will [<script name="be able">makeQuizElem2('YmUgYWJsZQ==', '&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] to fix it // no doctor will agree to fix it ... it's beyond 'ice cream tendencies' ... and henceforth the whole subject of '[<script name="not losing martial arts entirely">makeQuizElem2('bm90IGxvc2luZyBtYXJ0aWFsIGFydHMgZW50aXJlbHk=', '&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>]' narrative is a very difficult subject to digest (daily) ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Point being that life is full of unexpected sharp falls (like zygo 'ostrov'-movie-style mistake) but still, probably, thinking 'ahh ph*ckk it, this life is all about 'luck factor' anyway no matter how hard you innerly try' is probably not the 'least bad trajectory' of when faced with choices.
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ Or at least when you're in such prolonged state of 'f*ck i tried so hard and mishap stiked me and all my efforts were in vain ... so ... wtf bother ... next zygomatic-fracture grade fall is around the corner anyway' - trembling to 'snap out' of such state and trying for outside gps's.

[>] Women: In a sense that if you say that 'bla bla being in a cult for 35 years and denouncing david miscavige of his kind' later on is also a shitty living and 'least bad trajectory' could be still to 'keep hanging' like this then after some time of watching a cult video/podcast an impending doom arises that, m, the women/dudayev issue is unadressed in this, m, so-called 'least bad trajectory' state -- and it is yes sharp and it will yes keep resurfacing ... to the extent that it will 'break me' and not enough to think 'aaa, people in cults even gave birth because the leader just told them so' and then 'treated their children like unrelated objects' ... and it will still most likely will 'break' me ... like, wtf ... in 'wtf, I'm not normal' sense ... so f*ck that -- still going to david miscavige like cult and fack ya all ya scamma!
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ So in that sense the 'strengthener' might be to yes watch 'mra documentaries' and podcasts and get 'late age' context from there too (not only from 'cults documentaries' ...) as that also could help me friction that 'f*ck this all - still need a cult here even though they warned agains those' ... e.g. maybe siphon even more context of 'how people were miserable with women' to 'stabilise' the dick instincts ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ Goal: gather context to protect yourself from 'loser' innuendo (or 'loser overwhelm' innuendo) ... and keep doing self-ifs or whatever's more potent / more resonant than ifs for inner (and dudayev's) (and maybe ancestral generational etc.) traumas ...

[>] Martial arts podcasts (e.g. not 'cherry-picking' but binge listening) -- do they help or only aggravate the 'ostrov' movie face mistake problem? If yes - then how to get towards tai-chi book copycat-reading / copycat-memorising? Through ifs podcast? Through go/baduk podcast? (?)

[>] White Worms Truism, IFS, and Family Relations: 
[^ @ 1.] ^ We are all an 'advanced strain of monkeys' ...
[^ @ 2.] ^ Parents felt 'sad' and then 'found each other'
[^ @ 2.1.] ^ Then parents felt again 'sad' and asked heavens for a child and it brought the a child.
[^ @ 3.] ^ From the perspective of a parent: a parent had his parents have the same process (felt 'sad', etc.) so he doesn't have to know jack sh*t about sh*t (structure of the world, why the f*ck the humanity exists, what's or who's behind it all ... all he is concerned is that so it went on for generations before him and no one knows or can definitely verify the what was the origin of it all from where and how all this 'chain' events started ... etc.)

[#] Polarization: Father and Gush Agadol Polarization (or maybe more than one) [pls don't change this header - it's referenced in somewhere else.]

Preamble: So first of all - there are 2 or three polarizations here

[>] Polarization [#5.1]: I feel like on one hand I wanted myself to move to ramat aviv and now I'm delaying and want to 'repent' my 'slow gathering' by doing him a programming excercise as a safety net (but that was when I had 8-9k$ do-kwon money 'safety net' but now sbf is bankrupt too if that's of any help)
[@ ^ 1.] ^ In a sense, I feel a sense of 'guilt' for not doing to him his excercise (if havent during a week made any progress).

[>] Polarization (or many polarisations) [#5.2]: He is threatening me now with a court order to vacate me forcefully out of petah-tikva, yet I myself have a _very deep_ blended parts that are not even _willing_ to go into that terrtory (one of them says: 'you need more crypto to open that sh*t [discussion] up' (crypto, that I don't have, and unable to systematically/methodologically get (who knows what amber price will be (could be as well 250$)) ... to the extent that, m, 'm-kay ... we're going into the ward once more!' (as in 'I had serious cptsd trauma ... they will be checking me up' and making me even more cripple in the process with their 'extensive tests' ...))

Preamble 2 - describing as thoroughly as possible - my current psychological and/or cohesiveness situation

[>] First of all with the assumption of 'r/MenGetRapedToo' subreddit existence, supposedly I could somewhat stay barely above the 'I enjoy rape in prison' state (which nullifies any desire whatsoever) (including the desire that emanates from this very body) to move to 'gush agadol' 'jascha heifetz' appartment.
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Again this is still very, m, fragile fact because traveling to ramat aviv every 72 hours to 'replenish that aflsd && r/MenGetRapedToo reservoir' will be harder now, due to rains, etc.
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ As I've said above, 'I enjoy rape in prison' state _nullifies any desire whatsoever_ (including transition to any 'jascha heifetz' what-mind-you) so I'm more like, m, in a post-trauma state of a  'sack' that just 'metaphorically' 'rots in his own feces' (no offense, I'm just trying to be 'didactic' here (so I could understand myself the next time I read those text ...)

[>] ^^ To emphasize, when I'm in 'rape in prison enjoy' state, I literally don't care about any, m, and don't even _object_ to some 'additional tests' that 'those people' in psych ward will do to me ... in fact - I'd rather _enjoy_ it ...
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ How in practice that would play out? -- G-d knows! ... But I suppose, eventually at some early stage of hospitalisation I'll feel that 'ashpala sidratit' vibes by other 3 people in the room and will want out ... (but again, this is like we've described earlier - the 'recurrent isolator' 'fingers-in-the-isolator-socket' phenomenon) ...
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ I can't really ... even now ... blended parts ... nobody will care there about neither 'blended parts' nor ifs or/and probaby I will forget about ifs altogether for the time being ...
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ But again - the guess is -- that trauma is so deep and the unblending work that is needed is so f*cking massive, that not sure that during lifetime, less to say during father constrained-time that he wishes for -- will I be able to unblend those ... so this is like a lottery -- will they hospitalise? won't they hospitalise? -- it's really a 'lottery-grade' question, due to the super-mega complexity of the current situation.

[>] ^^ On the third note, when I'm thinking about describing that very situation to him, and asking him for further help, to avoid the aforementioned hospitalisation, I get vibes like 'это будет ошибка, идиот!' from my parts (that are probably blended in some clusterfuckiada, without them realising, that actually the hospitalisation is the one, that will fuck me up even thousand millions times more, that after it - I'll get tens of thousands of more parts and complexities and complications (because saintars are harsh (we remember it - can't take away the memory (at least (?))) ...
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ So then again here question comes to: so parts tell me 'это ошибка, идиот!' невзирая на предстоящую катастрофу (напоминает мне 'deer-in-headlights' state ...) ... and they are 'resilient' to the extent that I can't 'bypass' them, now can I? (Without actually 'meeting' 'friendly' 'sanitars' for the second time)?

Preamble 3 - Doing programming work to 'checkmate' his part that is trying to prove that I'm 'mentally incapable' via 'programming assignments' is a 'no-go'

[>] Doing any programming work to 'checkmate' his ifs-part that is trying to prove that I'm 'mentally incapable', via 'programming assignments' is impossible, and I cannot utilize OpenAI for that purpose ...

Preamble 4 - Focus on getting to 8-9-20k$ in the next 5-6 years (wtfs and elaborations)

[>] So basically we've said that this [hope], so far is the only thing that holds us from, m, total irreluctance to whether a psychitatric hosptialisation will be or will not be ...
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ I assume that I have written dtao already today, before modifying this section further ...
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ Supposedly when I have 8-9-20k$ -- then some ifs-part of me will feel enough 'safety' ['safety-net'] that it will be able to 'open up' to me ... (and without that/those part(s) opening up to me -- it's all -- 'psychiatric institution -- no psychiatric institution --> don't f*cking care jo f*ckking bit ...' ...) ... otherwise, with current 'safety net' conditions -- it doesn't feel safe enough to open up to me -- so we're proactively, then, 'rowing' towards that direction (again, after having written all the previous dtao's that I devised earlier on, today (at current '2022.xx.xx' date)) ...

[>] ^^ So what's the best for the 'psychiatric hospitalisation irreluctance' --> focus on '8-9-20k$' in '5-6 years' OR focus on { maintaining the same level of ELO (and not 'degrading') vs. 'cryptocurrencies'} ?

[>] ^^ This goal (8-9-20k$ in crypto) is supposedly 'doesn't hurt nobody' or has to do with any 'specific' people but rather: _anonymously_ doing some specific activities, that some certain people (ceo's of dapp & ecosystem startups) whom I _don't even know face-to-face_, hint at, without ever knowing them face-to-face or having to interact with them one single bit.

[>] So far, the sense is ... that after having written the 'frontal collision' 'o-wgiph/o-wbiph' and realised that the part that says: 'The damage that is done is so f*****g huge already ... that another, second hospitalization, doesn't not really make any difference' (in contrast to the damage that has already been done) (e.g. is negligible in the face of the already existing vast damage) ... so far the sense is to 'keep trembling for 'frontal collision with sanitars'' ...

[>] ^^ Due to 'virulent & cautistic' cptsd critic that keeps being 'pervasive', thought of devising the following dtao: how bad is to 'talk to father about chess' in perspective of (amidst impending danger of) 'second psychiatric hospitalization' ... ==> so like:
[@ ^ 1.] Dtao: ('talking to father about chess') ('amidst impending danger of') ('second psychiatric hospitalization')

Preamble 6 - tbd1,,

----
[>] Theoretically with the assumption of existence of current crypto funds, gains.trade practice mode existence - 

[>] 

[>] So far what am I doing right now, is 24/7 trying to, m, 
[>] First let's start with the 
Preamble 2 - what tbd1,,

[>] ^ It's difficult to do father's programming excercise when you realise how much he & michael & kanevsky et. al. f*cked you ... so how exactly do you want to do to him his f*cking excercise - he tho f*kkk did it! Destroyd my programming career! With his 'the parks here are ok' gaslight!
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ But then the problem is that you yourself need ramat aviv for whatever's leftover is left off 'programming job' because in petah-tikva under 'crowdedness' (they just don't understand what a quietness environment is -- is's beyond the reach of their grasp (and it sort of can be yes understood somewhat -- you need a 'medical clown' profession in 'extremely cramped' environments etc etc etc.) it's just not possible to ever code and the government don't care - he just say -- you can't find a job - then you're a f*cking invalid. It's not our responsibility that the neighborhoods are 'cramped' - says the [<script name="government">makeQuizElem2('Z292ZXJubWVudA==', '&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>]. 'Get along!' - says the government. So it is strictly my 'operation grandma' or whatever you want to call it under the 'dumb boar' government (just like steven king wrote in his 1963 book about american government whilst comparing it to a russian 'bear hug' government.) ...

[>] ^^ You do talk to him on the phone do you? ==> So this is a f*cking coherence problem right there!


[>] Дневник: 2022.11.03 -- вчера ты в соответствии с этой самой 'поляризацией' не поехал в квартиру туда к нему а ему 'позвонил' -- после этого 'перекурил' и (возможно еще будут само-подзатыльники сегодня, но) -- сегодня, 2022.11.03 - Я тебе говорю что звонок ему вчера в том формате какой он был или вообще звонок ему - это была ошибка ... потому что сейчас Я лазаю на стены от беспомощности - и соседи ухмыляются и ехидничают надо мной - и ничего шеньки, ничего -- мне не помогает.
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Прошу тебя, умоляю тебя - не звони ему просто так собака сволочь ты проклятая. Пусть Я в петах тикве еще долго останусь жить (как в 'ссылке' в сибири ...) но хотя бы отсюда Я могу на велосипеде вечером до моря доехать... и пусть теть ира с дядь гришей переезжают куда хотят и мухлючат там с квартирами что хотят. Сейчас Я здесь. И воюю со злыми собаками вокруг. И инициировать контакт со злыми собаками не надо. Они и так олл овер май кейс. Типа может эта поляризация -- не совсем 'тщательно' продуманна.

[#] Polarization: { 'Zygomatic photogenic face loss' was an unforgivable 'ostrov'-movie-grade mistake vs. 'Squashing violence and corruption-emanating coercion is felt all around me even with that deformed non-symmetric face structure' }

[>] ^^ 'Shame-induced self-harm' ==> 'Как ты смеешь вообще с таким лицом наружу показываться, ты [<script name="урод несусветный">makeQuizElem2('0YPRgNC+0LQg0L3QtdGB0YPRgdCy0LXRgtC90YvQuQ==','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] !?!?!' ==> Иногда у меня бывают такие 'эпизодики' с самим собой (!!) и иногда они доходят до само-брутальностей над собой (!!) ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ А с другой стороны ты явно чувствуешь нутром { 'subtle power plays' / 'subtle coercion dynamics' / tbd1 } all around you - for which - martial arts and nothing else - are yes indicated.

[>] ^^ Or is there even a 'polarisation'? (?)
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Addl (second part of polarisation if there even is a polarisation): 'I'm always surrounded by dogs',, 'It all comes down to force (or else it's sand-in-the-eyes)',, 'Government-backed feminism nonsense overwhelm' ,,

[>] ^^ Basically on one hand: you know, or at least the 'photogenic' younger you - knew -- that 'it all comes down to force no shit and there's no way you're gonna convince me otherwise' ... and henceforth martial arts are completely legit, and worth to die for rather than skip a bjj class.
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ On the other hand, you've said: wtf those martial arts are worse than prison ... even after prison some people get out perfectly photogenic! And this!?!?!? -- Look what this one did to me!?!?!?!
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ But again ... on the very low level gut level -- you still feel that, umm, martial arts are still 'valid' even after a horrific aesthetic injury that some crazy (or hostile) guy in there did to you ... so you're trying 'not to lose' the martial arts narrative 'entirely' and even though tai-chi could be by many accounts considered a laughable form of martial arts by many ... self-rehearsed chin-na is better than no-chin-na at all (or something along these lines)

[>] Martial arts that are done entirely in your head - is a 'mental masturbation' so I suppose some sort of 'dance meditation' with some random not-necessarily-effective martial moves mimicking - if you could do it every (or almost every day) -- you could at least say: 'I [<script name="tried my best">makeQuizElem2('dHJpZWQgbXkgYmVzdA==','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] not to lose martial arts narrative' compared to if you just done them in your head. 
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Because again, the 'it all comes down to force no shit and there's no way you're gonna convince me otherwise' frame still makes at least _some_ sense ... I 'sense' it every f*cking day in some certain gps locations especially ... those subtle, hidden, but definitely 'sensed' 'power plays' ... and even though the format of 'thrill-driven rolling with few partners every week' format - is overwhelming or even would, if properly researched, turn out to be medically incorrect, in a sense that 'thrill' perhaps should not be mixed into a weekly training due to burnouts and injuries (like the one that I had with some fractured bone) 
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ even though the format might turn out to be not correct for all populations -- until it is 'corrected' and such form of 'trauma-aware martial art' would be prominent all over the world and 5-10 clubs in tel aviv would open (like there's now with bjj) ... -- until then I at least do tai-chi kata as to not to lose martial arts narrative entirely ... 'лучше синица в руке чем журавль в небе' итп ...
[>>> 1.1.1.1.] ^^ I wouldn't be the one to do it because - or who knows -- but at least do a f*cking tai-chi excercise daily you can do (and smoking) -- so first pls establish a consistent tai-chi regular activity (without smoking) -- and then and only then you could worry about 'opening your own trauma aware dojo' (but if you start smoking once again -- then close theere fokkr dojo again) ...

To Recap:
[>] Q. Why just copy-catting jwing ming chin-na books and dvd's into your head - is not enough and you should do some stupid tai-chi kata? ==> 'Don't lose martial arts entirely' narrative is not kept then, if it's all done in your head .. e.g. if you assume that, m, a laptop/pc is an 'extension of human brain' ...  
[>] Q. Why immediately jumping to watching bjj seminar vids and/or even reading bjj book every day - after you sense coercive violence all around -- is probably not such a good idea? ==> A1: 'Shame-induced self-harm' ==> 'Как ты смеешь вообще с таким лицом наружу показываться, ты [<script name="урод несусветный">makeQuizElem2('0YPRgNC+0LQg0L3QtdGB0YPRgdCy0LXRgtC90YvQuQ==','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] !?!?!' ==> Иногда у меня бывают такие 'эпизодики' с самим собой (!!) и иногда они доходят до само-брутальностей над собой (!!) ...

[>>> 1.1.] ^^ And will being bended to an extreme extent -- you'd smoke to avoid, m, recurrent hospitalization && being 2 weeks with foreign males in the same room ('privacy 'squashed' ...) ...

[>] ^^ The point, though, is that I feel that I've by this point smoked way, way beyond allowable ... ==> So supposedly then I must then resort to 'white worms' polarisation (to have a 'clear mind', still) ...

[#] Мои прорывы к ifs-терапевту (IFS Therapist Crawling mode)...

[##] Preamble 54: Q & A (skip this section if in real distress) (I just don't know where to shove it but 'not knowing where to shove it' is not a 'real distress' there are worse!! so then skim if this is worse! Maybe I'll find later a more appropriate place, for this Q&A -- maybe not ... but for now it's stuck f**cking stuck here, sorry!)

[>] Q. Why not play chess with IFS therapist (or simultaneously with few IFS therapists)?
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ A1.1. ^^ In regard to the game of 'chess' though ... trying to pull off the 'win-lose' frame with an ifs therapist would probably get the 'my way or high way' vibe ... as opposed to 'sturdier boundaries' go-game ...

[##] Preamble 18 - What else to do (besides nothing):

[>] [TREMBLE_FOR_1] Emergency Response Group #1: 'Tremble' for yourself whilst in this mode ... (because it's too f*cking close to 'coercive psychiatry' already) ...

---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ----
[##] Preamble 25 - Q. Maybe you need texel-only chess teacher instead? How do you know? (?) ... tbd1,,

[>] ^^ How do you know whether you should go to 'IFS Therapist' or to 'Texel-Only Chess teacher'? Because an IFS Therapist might be needing himself money for fixing his car so he could be 'hanging' onto his clients who give him money and not letting them go 'your xyz part doesn't like me' says he ... 'so what' ... (it's a cult and in reality it's very difficult close to impossible to switch ifs therapists ...) ... Keep 'trembling' though (for 'IFS Therapist' (if that's ever possible ...) ...) ...

[>] ^^ Game of GO is a game of de-facto building sturdy boundaires with your opponent ... and we've already determined, via mp-3mp-apr that even between two-three most powerful presidents there are boundaries henceforth there's no man that 'has no boundaries with any other man' ... 

[>] ^^ There are also boundaries between me and a random IFS therapist that I want to enroll with (as there are always boundaries between any two males (see mp-3mp-apr)) 

[>] ^^ Important unique property of GO is that it's, besides being a 'sturdier-boundaries-setting' game, is also is a 'lesser-trollable' game e.g. ifs therapist could 'troll' you in tetris-attack with reaction speed, in a gacha game with buying & fusing more 5-star heroes,, in civ because he could reframe it to civ5 instead of civ4,, tbd1,,

[>] ^^ Not reading (or at least 'glancing at' and then 'tracking on some medium') go book can be a show-stopper that impedes a further 'interactive go studying' 

---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ----
[##] Preamble 37 - Q. Playing go (or chess) with the 'ifs therapist' - rationale ...

[>] ^^ There might be a 'hospitalizing cop' side to an 'ifs therapist' too!!! -- you never know!!! ...

[>] ^^ In a sense that, this is of course a huge over-exaggeration (because mother and father 'snitched' at me last time (they even admitted that on the phone to me ('У нас нервишки сдали так вот мы тебя и определили' так мне папаша по телефону сказал ...)) ... but, nevertheless after 'seeing' what's possible, the boundary (or the 'trust' whatever you want to call it ...) has forever been breached ... and so excericse caution might never hurt (James Duane clearly advised to never talk to any police and again, even richard schwartz himself needed an ifs therapist a few times so it's not 'hermetic' ... overwhelming states do happen ... so but then, if you can manage to remember that he has also a 'cop' hat and try and be diplomatic and say only the reductionist minimum, whilst visiting him, this absolutely makes sense to try and say to him only things that are related to chess (or shogi (or xiagqi))) ... (just like with twitter & discord) ... (because the 'black cow' of a 'hospitalizing therapist' does yes exist on the planet earth))) ... 

[>] ^^ Shogi / Xiangqi are also 'lesser-trollable' games (a win can't be bought with money (feh), sleight-of-hand (tetris attack), has no 'new versions' trolling (like civ5 vs. civ6)) (+ Kaufman post)

[>] ^^ But again, if you try to play the game of 'chess'/'shogi'/'xiangqi' with 'ifs therapist' ... trying to pull off the 'win-lose' frame with an ifs therapist would probably get the 'my way or high way' vibe ... as opposed to 'sturdier boundaries' go-baduk-game ... and there's a difference between 'saying minimalist-reductionist things' and 'skipping' things that are not related to chess at all (aka 'al tosif' (heb)) versus 'setting up a win-loss dynamic' ... одно дело ты 'промалчиваешь' а другое дело ты - пытаешься его обыграть (посредством 'мата', вместо посредством 'расстановки более заумных/четких/озвученных граней' как в 'го') ...

---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ----
[##] Preamble 35 - Q. Playing go is 'idiotism' at many levels, but when it comes to the mode that you are 'crawling towards' an ifs therapist ...

[>] ^^ Playing go is 'idiotism' at many levels, but when it comes to the mode that you are 'crawling towards' an ifs therapist ... then ... it suddenly 'obtains a different shade' as, m, there are no two men on this planet who don't have 'boundaries' with any other man (as we've seen in mp-3mp-apr ('why suffer the burdens of a presidency?' -- 'Because wife will find a 'better man' ...' ..., etc, etc, etc. ('why madoff suicide in prison? ...' ...)) ...

[>] ^^ So then if we've established that go is important in some contexts such as 'crawling towards' an 'ifs therapist' (and go is a game of 'setting sturdier boundaries' with your opponent and vs. 'caving in' (which is the opposite of 'setting boundaries' ...) ...) ... but then again the 'crawl' is real, the 'gaslighting' is real, and absolutely 'hermetic' boundaries with an ifs therapist are probably not possible, even for richard schwartz ... so ifs therapist still stays relevant ... regardless of the game ...

[>] ^^ In regard to the game of 'chess' though ... trying to pull off the 'win-lose' frame with an ifs therapist would probably get the 'my way or high way' vibe ... as opposed to 'sturdier boundaries' go-game ...

[>] ^^ So then we orient on 'shavit fragman's go meetups' and try to 'improve in go' to not embarass yourself there ... (book, summary-in-100btc-html, what else?)

---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ----
[##] Preamble 195 - Q. When I 'tremble' for 'playing go game with an ifs therapist (or multiple therapists simultaneously)' -- I reach a 'what-ifs cornered' state -- now what? 

[>] ^^ Q. When I 'tremble' for 'playing go game with an ifs therapist (or multiple therapists simultaneously)' -- I reach a 'what ifs cornered' state -- 'no, you can't do that!' / 'No, it would be too difficult' / etc. -- and the problem is, that even though I can remain in this state and keep 'trembling' for 'playing go with ifs therapists (or simultaneously with few therapists)' ... this still is somewhat kinda an f****cking intolerable 'itchy' (so to speak) state ... from which I (or some part or side within me) strives to find a resolve. Like 'can't sit like a sitting duck' thing or something ...
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ On top of that I can't along with that state, get myself outside ... because ('No, it would be to difficult' / 'No, you can't' / etc.) so then I'm f*cking stuck like a 'DID in a wheelchair' then (?) (?) (?)
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ So far I see only one solution to this 'locked-in' 'what-ifs-cornered' state ... is to pivot into 'tremble' for 'bodyweight fitness' area (*1) ... 

[>] ^^ It's important to remeber for when I venture into 'tremble' for 'bodyweight fitness' area ... what usually happens is that I 'lose this document' and have to switch at some point to 'finding this document' via 'cptsd portals for reentry' ... 
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Q. And then back to 'playing go game with an ifs therapist' all over again? ==> It's not linear, this all requires effort and or releases emotional pain, and maybe hopefully improves me in a sense of '5000 depot shots won't help him' domain ... so it's not just a 'stupid' 'all-over-again' cycle that seems at first glance ... (If I can manage to pull it off ... sometimes I can't even manage and stuck somewhere along the way!!!)

[>] ^^ It's also important to note that 'bodyweight fitness' is a sort of relation to 'abandoning martial arts completely' narrative (yet sometimes that one is 'overwhelming' at such states (of 'what-if-corneredness intolerability') so then left it at 'bodyweight fitness' state (?)

[###] Refs (pertaining to this section):
[>] (*1) It might make sense because men, might, stand-up for their boundaries, defend their boundaries, and/or re-assert their boundaries aggressively ...

---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ----
[##] Preamble 234 - Q. Online or offline baduk teacher? (in parallel to an ifs therapist?)? (since I've disqualified 'chess' already ...)

[>] ^^ Most important probably, before I ever found one permanent or semi-permanent teacher, now that it's situational hint, is to remember that most likely one culprit to remember and what intuition-wise propels me towards 'teacher' beyond 'twitch streams and book and katrain' ... is that I want to shut up on the internet no matter what ... no matter how lucrative and humanity-saving, etc. it seems to post this thing on the internet ... is to shut the f*ck up even beyond the filters ... into read-only mode ... but nevertheless ...

[>] ^^ Filter reminder: before posting, consider whether it's related to chess ...

[>] ^^ Filter reminder: before posting, try to say in your mind 'cohesive singular identity' ==> 'cohesive' + < what you are about to post > + 'identity' (sometimes this helps regain ground) ... 


---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ----
[##] Preamble 735 - Q. If 'ifs therapist' has that 'hospitalizing cop' hat ... does 'nadine lucas's' group have that 'cop' hat (e.g. if I participate via 'audio-only' for example? (?))

[>] ^^ Try replacing (as with 'chatgpt chatting on the internet' was) ==> 'cohesive singular identity' with 'cohesive' < nadine lucas''s group > 'identity' ...


---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ----
[##] Preamble 735 - 'Trembling' for 'IFS Therapist' and 'Geography' ...

[>] ^^ So, I 'Trembled' for 'bridge & geography' (in 'ifs' context, aka some part is desperately 'trying to 'teach you how to smoke'' because it's desperately disagrees with something and ...) ... and eventually after one day of doing this ... some voice started yelling at me: 'you are going to explode! explode!' and out of fear for that ... I've said ok, 'some part is warning me about something' and I was 'crawling towards an ifs therapist' a day before ==> So now, let's then replace it with 'ifs therapist' && 'geography' ...
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Yet again, the premise with 'bridge', was, that, m, if I have that, m, overwhelming crypto-crypto voice ... -- is the need for 'holding onto my crypto', as, the need for '3h bridge punishment', -- spacial? In a sense that, in petah tikva I'd need extremely bridge 3h punishment (due to { lack of prison vs. freedom discernance } combined with { the need for self-disciplining and self-accountability} ?) yet in ramat-gan--near-bney-brak I'd need 'less of' 3h bridge punishment to get by ... and in 'shikun lamed and ramat aviv' I'd need even less of 'bridge 3h punishment'? I'm saying that because, bridge 3h punishment makes me wanna teach myself to smoke, and I'm almost puking when I'm peeing (def. a serious health problems down the road ...)
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ Basically, though, it feels similarly with IFS in a sense that in petah-tikva I feel that 'in no way I could be an 'IFS therapist' ...' yet in shore-border-proximity zone (when passing through there on the bycicle) I feel like, pheeew ... I could _easily_ be an IFS therapist! ... so like ...
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ 'Tremble' for 'ifs' ... (sanitars do not have to care for, m, 'no bad parts' premise ...)
[@ ^ 1.1.1.1.] ^^ 'Tremble' for 'disruptive technologies' (&& 'people are slowly catching up' ... somebody's writing minecraft as we speak ...,, somebody's writing a super-custom 'leverage trading simulation app' as we speak ...) ...
[@ ^ 1.1.1.1.1.] ^^ Sometimes you still have nowhere to shove your notes ... and versatile minecraft 32-bit w/indexed note searching, portals, android, encryption, would still be helpful in that regard.

---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ----
[##] Preamble 1544 - Q. 'What-ifs corneredness', 'ifs therapists', and 'chin-na verification' ...

[>] ^^ 'Tremble' for 'bridge & geography' (in 'ifs' context, aka some part is desperately 'trying to 'teach you how to smoke'' because it's desperately disagrees with something and ...)
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ 'Tremble' for 'ifs' ... (sanitars do not have to care for, m, 'no bad parts' premise ...)
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ 'Tremble' for 'disruptive technologies' (&& 'people are slowly catching up' ... somebody's writing minecraft as we speak ...,, somebody's writing a super-custom 'leverage trading simulation app' as we speak ...) ...
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ Sometimes you still have nowhere to shove your notes ... and versatile minecraft 32-bit w/indexed note searching, portals, android, encryption, would still be helpful in that regard.

[>] ^^ Tetris-attack and ifs therapists ==> too many 'you're such an idiot!' critics ==> go to ifs therapist ==> tetris-attack could curcumvent this (but only this particular case with 'you're idiot' critics,, it's not the cure-all!!!) ... b/c an idiot is one, who doesn't notice a 'wildly emerging pattern' and tetris-attack is a game of 'pattern matching' ... but there's a 'burnout' (or is there?) (is there 'enough enough' with tetris attack? (?))

[>] ^^ Trauma Venting Process 'coming with 10 random past traumas on paper, and throwing them into the river, etc.' on paper (ChatGPT-approved timeline excercise) could help actually not fall on the 'policeman's hat' of an 'ifs therapist' ...

---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ----
[##] Preamble 178 - Q. What has happened last time with Nadine Lucas's Zoom Group and with IFS Therapist - and why aiming & striving towards an IFS therapist might sometimes work yet might sometimes stumble upon a situational dead-end (or something along those lines) ...

[>] ^^ Again, you might remember at some point that an IFS therapist, although is better than a psychiatrist, still holds, the, m, the other, the policeman's hat ... and hence forth you might feel compelled at times to move matters with him to writing (as Uncle James suggested ...) ...
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Again, with writing, with an IFS therapist, a therapy sessions might not, m, work as originally intended aka one-hour sit-on-the-couch-and-talk session thing ... but rather more like one-hour sit on-the-couch-and-exchange-written-notes thing ... or 'exchange-paper-drawings' thing (which already happened with some psychiatrist at ichilov once whatevers ...) ...

---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ----
[##] Preamble 65 - Q. Sometimes, _if_ protector questions pages that you got from ChatGPT are 'palpatable' -- when and how do you switch from 'crawling towards ifs therapist' mode, to 'trembling' for { 'ifs protector questions' and 'ChatGPT' } mode? (?) 

[>] ^^ Answer is -- jump on every such opportunity? (?) Until they are totally 'unreachable' again? (?)

[##] Preamble 225 - Martial arts are probably 100 preambles ahead (and this preamble probably will/should be moved 100 ahead), but ...

[>] ^^ How are then after 'baduk with ifs therapist' (baduk was there because there are boundaries between any two men), are 'martial arts' related now? ==> I suppose because 'just baduk' is supposedly not enough to sort of metaphorically 'get up' and 'walk away' from an abusive ifs therapist ... it's just not going to happen with baduk alone (but then again ... the distance is like 100 more 'preambles' from here) ...

[##] Preamble 48 - tbd1,,

[>] ^^ Assuming: ChatGPT exists, tbd1 ...

[>] [MOVE_TO_WRITING_1] Emergency Response Group #2: Also, try to 'accentuize' on moving things and thoughts to paper as quickly as possible (if ever possible) (because 'Groovy guy' said so) (as hopefully should be with ifs therapist (or any other therapist (over the long term (they don't like legal threats (kind of scared of them ...))))) ...
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Discarding paper and 'paper security' also belongs here but as a first response to 'ifs therapists crawling mode' - it's 'out of scope' in/within this situational 'crawl' context (so for now leaving 'clog' to some other later 'emergency response group') -- but nevertheless should be hopefully taken care of somehow, anyhow, at a later time. etc.

[>] [CHESS_GO_ELO_LEVEL_SAME_1] Emergency response Group #3: Chess/Go ==> Things will inevitably slip with ifs therapist, the less slipped -- the better (the less years of hospitalization period afterwards, etc.) (IFS Therapist is yes close to hospitalization).

[>] [THIS_VERY_DOCUMENT_1] Emergency response group #4: Not losing this document via leverage-trading et. al. so when the next time I'm 'triggered'/'flashbacked' ==> I'll have access to this very list in my head.

[>] Emergency response group #18, tbd1: Paper security (maybe this is not even an 'emergency response' but 'post-lateral response')
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ There's also 'paper security' issue whereas you cannot properly articulate your thoughts if you can't write words like 'kill' or 'sucidide' on paper.
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ There's substitution db, but also there's 'paper disposal' procedure stuckness through which you won't be able to trust yourself, to write next piece of conversation with ifs therapist on paper, if it's get clogged in the house, for everyone to see. You just won't trust, will say 'a, ph*ck it!' and will move on onto talking to him _without paper_ (whether you had a proper paper disposal routine in place, or you did not).

==> (Совсем забыл. Сломался стакан.) Где-то да найдем его. Аминь.

[>] Also, try to 'accentuize' on moving things and thoughts to paper as quickly as possible (if ever possible) (because 'Groovy guy' said so) (as hopefully should be with ifs therapist (or any other therapist (over the long term (they don't like legal threats (kind of scared of them ...))))) ...

Common Why's:
[>] Тело мое не подчиняется мне - в том плане что Я требую от него чтобы оно не курило - а оно всеравно затягивается сигаретами ... в упор ... Я потерял над ним (над своим телом) контроль ...
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ И поэтому хочу к ифс терапевту прорваться Я ради спасения своей же жизни (чтобы хотя бы не к психиатру когда угожу - чтобы был у меня ифс - терапевт хотя бы раз в месяц.)
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ Я в упор чувствую что с каждой сигаретой мой организм все слабеет (это достаточно заметно) ... и просто сижу в терроре что вот сейчас сейчас что-то  [<script name='невыносимой болью'>makeQuizElem2('0L3QtdCy0YvQvdC+0YHQuNC80L7QuSDQsdC+0LvRjNGO','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] зажмет ...

// [>] Is 'ifs therapists' portal - open?

[>] Q. How the f*ck do I assert asking from him money for ifs therapists? So I'd have that 'safety net'? (?)
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ How? How?

Post-amble:
[>] Q. How the f*ck does ever 'ifs therapist crawling mode' ever spark during out of f*cking nowhere in the middle of the day? ==> Evidence-flipping socially-proofed knockos (who play football nearby). ==> The fear is very real: 'он ударился об дубинку санитара' // 'он стукнул в нос нашу бедную собачку' // 'he's yelling weirdly all the time and we are afraid what he might do to our children (especially the female gender)' // (tbd1) ==> And henceforth a natural reaction is to find the group 'backup' of your own (that could verify your 'side' of the story).

This was after years of being misdiagnosed, really resonating with the CPTSD diagnosis, but realizing some of my symptoms were making it very hard to have relationships or function in society in a pleasant way.\n\nI LOVE reframing these disorders as complex and even needed reactions to trauma, but I see a big problem in CPTSD communities and in communities where people had trauma.\n\nThe biggest problem I see seems to fit in really well with cluster B traits. On the extreme end, in certain places where people talk about narcissism and being abused by narcissism, I see a lot of black and white thinking, victim narrative, good vs bad, etc. \n\nNPD is a serious disorder, and while many people have narcissistic traits, including healthy people, for society to all of a sudden think that anyone who harmed them has NPD and can be cast off into \u201cbad\u201d category is disheartening. \n\nIt\u2019s not NEARLY as bad on this subreddit, don\u2019t get me wrong. But this subreddit lacks something other mental health subreddit have\u2014which is personally responsibility. When we have an emotional flashback, we react in not-normal ways to a small trigger someone else might do. This is really just rephrasing cluster B traits, which could for instance involve splitting and dissociation. I love the way it\u2019s rephrased, it allows us forgiveness for ourselves and allows us to understand what is happening. But we need MORE than that.\n\nWe must move beyond the victim complex, we must take responsibility for our actions, we must fight to not let this illness keep us where we are. In the beginning, I thought CPTSD was the best diagnosis ever, because it stopped stigmatizing those with trauma and let the world know that it really wasn\u2019t our fault.\n\nBut the longer I was stuck, the more I realized that the reason I loved it so much was it furthered reinforced the victim narrative in my head and that I was the \u201cgood guy\u201d while my abusers were \u201cbad guys.\u201d (I am not claiming anyone should forgive abusers. The healthiest thing imo would be to understand they are in the grey and view them with nuance, but still say they have no place in your life.) \n\nIt IS healthy and, I think when fully integrated, will be the absolute best diagnosis going forward. I did a ton of healing and work that helped me grow that I don\u2019t think would\u2019ve been possible without the label to understand it.\n\nBut at one point, I had developed self love, forgiven myself, but was still exhibiting these maladaptive behaviors that, frankly, were quite toxic. I think we need to integrate both self healing, forgiveness, understanding, etc with pragmatic ways to healthily interact with the world. \n\nWe need to understand that many of the ways we learned to cope are, in fact, toxic. This isn\u2019t fair, but it\u2019s the truth. It\u2019s why so many of us grapple with the abuse our parents places on us. Because we see that they were suffering, but that suffering does not negate toxicity. \n\n I see a lot of people rejecting cluster b diagnoses and/or demonizing then. Those are OUR people. The reason these are so heavily stigmatized is not because of the \u201clabel\u201d but because how traumatized people respond to the world. If CPTSD does replace these diagnoses, CPTSD will also be stigmatized. People stigmatize the ugly, trauma responses that we\u2019ve learned to use, not the name of our disorder. \n\nMy hope is that helping people understand that our responses are DUE to trauma will help reduce the stigma and bring some compassion. It\u2019s more about explaining why we do these things. But anti-social coping mechanisms are toxic regardless. It isn\u2019t fair, but if we want to heal we must take responsibility, accept who we are, and fight against this every day. It is not enough to reframe our experience with self love. We also must work on living with and loving others in healthy ways.",

She would access that part and hear what it has to say. This would help her to realize that there is more to her than the Temper Tantrum Part.

[#] Studying Yulia Varlakova's ifs polarisation resolving excercise for what-if-cornered states during the day (and comparing it to stephane/dangeli etc.) ...

[>] ^^ Youtube: 8shZvkxyAyY

[>] Q. What will happen if I talk about this excercise to the police (like I'd want to do with stephane)? ==> ?
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ What's the 'underlying dynamic that is involved here'? ==> That I cannot study 'situational stuckness' 'polarisation resolving' excercises of any kind whatsoever? Or what? (?)
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ How does that yulia's polarisation resolving excercise relate to 'no-bad-parts frame rupture'?

[>] [CRAWL_TOWARDS_IFS_THERAPISTS_1] Q. How does yulia's excercise relate to 'crawling towards ifs therapists'? ==> Still can't beat 'evidence-flipping' 'socially proofed' shuhrik!
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ With all that said, still hunting airdrops for 100$ in bitcoin for the purpose of finding this document ... - is overwhelming information activity and just focusing on 'varlakova' excercise && 'shuhrik' is not enough? (?) (unless you believe that bitcoin won't go into 0.00001$ never? (?)) ==> For expansion see below: 'Yulia Varlakova excercise and '100$ in bitcoin' information overwhelm'

[>] [100_IN_BITCOIN_1] Yulia Varlakova excercise and '100$ in bitcoin' information overwhelm ==> We said, that for this document to 'hold' -- we need 100$ in bitcoin ... and so we're still hunting airdrops (or should we?) I mean the probability is very low that I won't have 100$ in bitcoin in the next 10-20 years. Are we addressing that problem properly (e.g. via hunting new airdrops?)
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Common sense point 1: So generally you shouldn't invest more than ~20-30 minutes a day into new airdrop hunting, with the premise that I have enough money now to sustain 100$ bitcoin for next 10 years for sake of this document.
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ But there's limitless 'bonding leverage' problem! E.g. there's never enough 'bonding leverage' ==> You will most likely not attain this bonding leverage by airdrop-hunting for 8+ hours a day since this is an overwhelming, burnout-ish, and menual task (which has many chinese-farmers competitors) -- aka the 'investments-vs-results' problem.
[@ ^ 1.2.] ^^ With that said, if you were 'compulsively' on twitter today for 20-30 minutes already -- then supposedly today you have 'farmed' 'enough' (?) (and it's like, that, more 'organisedness' needs to be 'breathed in' (again, unless it's somewhat emergency, USDC crashed and you had to swap all wallets to dai).

[>] Varlakova excercise and 'hole in IFS'
[@ ^ 1.] If you have both 'No Bad Parts Frame rupture' _and_ 'you have no sugardaddy or a money for ifs therapist' ==> Then it's a 'hole' in 'ifs model'
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ It is a 'bad' hole (remember r/MenGetRapedToo?) in a sense that it introduces 'instability' and most likely 'unexpected bad (or bald (had to write the 'bald' here for some reason ...) surprises'
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ One ultra-superficial solution to this is study both {{ 'mozaic mind' (aka. 'ifs certification' books } and { 'smart contracts' / 'ida pro' / 'reactos' / 'programming methodology that separates me from a 12 year old smart contract developer' books } } ... 
[@ ^ 1.1.1.1.] If it's just a 'mozaic mind' then it's 1000 more broken tooth ahead (because you 'jumped trains at full speed' / 'do not stop something that works until something better came along' proverbs etc.) 
[@ ^ 1.1.1.1.1.] ^^ From the varlakova perspective though, it makes 'varlakova' excercise much more important because it can be done even when bankrupt. (It is ifs-approved (and academically peer-reviewed --> 500 ifs therapists will 'accept' (?) that excercise ...)
[@ ^ 1.1.1.2.] In regard to programming ==> programming has a 'stuckness point' at 'r/MenGetRapedToo' (and possibly 'r/nofap')

[>] [TAI_CHI_1] Varlakova excercise and tai-chi kata (after 6PM)
[@ ^ 1.] ^ It's very difficult (?) to prove the existence of 'forceful coercion' (or to 'deduce' 'forceful coercion' from perpetual knockors' noise -- some [ifs] part just says - 'no - I don't agree that it's a 'coercion' ...' ...) ==> So can't 'deduce' 'not abandoning martial arts narrative entirely' strictly from knocko-couch-draggers unfortunately (whilst respecting ifs principle of 'no bad parts') ... ==> ?
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^ [It was erased, but] you could without 'going directly against knockos' say that I get weird 'I enjoy rape in prison' states, (in certain, specific gps locations) ==> and then, should due to some weird perversiveness, things arrive to a real rape in prison scenario ==> arrive to that prison's rapist, knowing some chin-na (when facing that prison rapist) ... because I might not like it when he literaly starts touching my body (even though I desired it earlier) ... so I have at least some, m, 'safety net'/'kill switch' (so to speak) .. 
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^ After all If I read from r/MenGetRapedToo ==> There are some topics { "Does anyone else feel filthy and need to shower constantly?",, "I keep setting myself up for assault",, (tbd1) } which don't seem to be describing 'pleasureable'/'enjoyable'/'desireable' states at all ==> those topics do not look sympathetic at all!
[@ ^ 1.1.1.1.] ^ Dance Element of Tai-chi: It _feels_ like, martial arts that are totally 'in your head' - do still implicate that you have yes 'given up entirely on martial arts narrative' ... so memorising chin-na books only is not enough (if 'books only' then it sort of implies that 'yes given on martial arts narrative entirely') ==> so there has to be at least some 'out-of-your-head-only' activity adjacent to it ... ==> So far tai-chi aka 'dancing out martial arts moves in a 'wishwashy' way' fits the bill. It doesn't mean though, that after those 'wish-washy' moves, you want to stop and not pursue further the real studying of a more 'precise' (and not a 'wish-washy') versions of martial arts chin-na and ground chin-na maneuvers (now, that it's not 'entirely in your head' (for that day, after tai-chi that was done during that day, ...)) ...
[@ ^ 1.1.1.1.1.] ^^ But again, if you feel burned out enough from tai-chi alone ... then fack ya fack ya fack ya -- at least let it be tai-chi alone ... (and not a total 'abandon of martial arts subject entirely whatsoever' ...) ...
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ Since varlakova's excercise resembles stephane closely ==> 'Stephane Ball won't open / Protector won't step aside' (and on the other hand 'IFS therapists' have 'ban' - so at least to keep & maintain self-ifs option (need 'safety' for 'stephane ball to open' (and to sh*t up about stephane even for a second prison term)) ...
[@ ^ 3.] ^^ I wrote already that I 'enjoy' rape in prison, but there's one thing that I still do not enjoy, and that is 'ifs therapists ban' vs. 'sleep doctor's final verdict incoherence' (even though it's 'looking too long into an abyss' and 'sleep doctor' shouldn't be involved never) ... but nevertheless ... then at least I can say when '100x leverage trading' ... that 'I will end up 'in-between-chairs' in regard to { 'ifs therapists ban' vs. 'sleep doctor's final verdict incoherence' } ... if I keep { 100x leverage trading like that } ...' but again the connection is not fully apparent (tbd1,,)
[@ ^ 3.1.] ^^ So anyway the relation of tai-chi kata && chess to { ifs therapists } is that 'ifs is a cult' and with cult leader you deal via { 'playing chess with cult leader' && 'doing martial arts vs cult leader' (aka . not abandoning martial arts narrative entirely ...) } ... so henceforth a tai-chi connection to { 'some discernable activity that I do not 'enjoy' (like I for 'rape in prison' would ...) and 'want to avoid' } ... (?)
[@ ^ 4.] Toxic Shame is academically recognised as a toxic phenomenon (see internalguides.net) and sometimes fighting toxic shame requires 'manifesting non-comformism' (yelling in weird places, dressing sometimes inappropriately, etc.) ... and non-comformists are going to be 'pecked on' (remember that parenting.stackexchange.com post?) -- if you are not confident enough in your ability to 'back' 'non-comformism' (martial arts) then there's inability to manifest noncomformism which things get 'accumulated' inside to the extent that 1000 depot shots won't help.
[@ ^ 4.1.] ^^ So basically: 'Childhood trauma' ==> 'Toxic Shame' ==> Need 'nonconformism' (aka. yelling 'freedom' 'way too more often for the police's taste') to 'plow through' that toxic shame (or otherwise things will get 'clogged up' and no depot shots will help) ==> Noncomformists will be always, always pecked at (tbd1, https://parenting.stackexchange.com/questions/21393/impact-on-kids-not-having-tv (*1)) ==> Bjj & tai-chi & shibashi to 'back up' my 'non-comformisms' ('wtf ya')
[@ ^ 4.1.1.] (*1) "I think the question can be generalized to any form of non-conformism. People not fitting into the so-called "norm" will always be picked-on by some others, if not because of the TV? it will be clothes, music or simply physical difference. So it would basically depend on how far are you ready to go with "non-conformism" and how you would deal with possible problems happening..."
[@ ^ 4.1.2.] ^^ You end up like mr. fredricksen but at least less hospitalizations (?)
[@ ^ 5.] There is a 'hole' in 'IFS' in a sense that, m, when you have 'no bad parts frame rupture' and also 'are bankrupt' ... you can't m, just go to 'ifs therapist' or possibly even zoom chat on the cellphone (because you have no cellphone) ... and then you have to work on some menial job to get that cellphone and internet connection ... and in menial jobs there is a lot of 'autorative power abuse' ... and that's where 'martial arts' (or memorised bjj (worst case trust some book written by some bjj sparring champion)) become very important ...
[@ ^ 5.1.] ^^ Maybe also here need to self-study 'how to pass exams' book by dominic obrien because that whole 'studying via 1000 repetitions' vs. 'studying via memory palace pegging system' is a one huge 'burnout and overwhelm' headf*ckery and want 'optimal result here' in a sense that I have in my head most of bjj & chin na books contents without as much headfuckery as possible (maybe actually '1000 repetitions over time' will cause greater 'most bjj & chin-na' books in my head then indulging in 'how to pass exams' headf*ckery in the first place) ...
[@ ^ 5.1.1.] ^^ But memorisation systems sometimes (at some 'situational moments') seem *super, super* important and as if it's a 'deal breaker' without them. So welcome to the new headf*ckery realm! (But for now just do the 'base-touching'/'palpating' distress books (?) [2022.11.25]).

[>] Varlakova excercise and tai-chi incoherence (you're doing it but not re-watching or re-reading it)
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Worst case, read fiction book (tbd1,,)
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ Copy-cat random comparing between own summarised (own prepared 'images with red arrows designating movement directions' summaries) material, and 'book' (e.g. over-the-days checks, whilst labeling: '[last-date-check: 2022.02.02]' as goes with 'distress books' right now ...)
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ The assumption is that own summaries are better than videos (because it's at least scrollable pdf with a more-readily-searchable content than videos) ...
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Today skipping,, no crypto,, [2022.11.25]

[>] [GAMES_1] Varlakova excercise and playing any games whatsoever (even the more-trollable ones) after 6 PM ==> ?
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Since in some certain gps locations the discernance between 'prison' and 'freedom' is lost, the only discernance that is left is { 'ifs therapists ban' vs. 'sleep doctor's final verdict incoherence' } aka it is the only one thing that I don't 'enjoy' (as compared to 'rape in prison', which I do 'enjoy' in those gps locations) ... and henceforth and but yet then since it is the discernance ... this means than then I'm automatically in the 'cult' of 'ifs therapists' and hence I should 'play chess (or even more trollable games?)' with 'cult leader' to not get to situation whereas I'm submitted into that cult further and further ... and supposedly 'more/less trollable games' are better than 'no games at all! (!!)' e.g. what I mean by that is that I should either play in my mind with either 'nadine lucas' and/or with 'akiva/keith wolff' (and/or with Osnat Arbel and/or with Einat Bronstein) in my mind ... (?)

[>] [PAPER_1] Varlakova excercise and longhand paper ... 
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Statistics on paper vs. 'statistics in the head' (aka. 'iterative probabilistic reasoning' (which is done 'over the days') will just not work without a 'recording' medium of some sort or you'll 'forget' what you 'thought' yestreday ...) (that's one example of 'wtf paper') ...

[>] [PAPER_1] Varlakova excercise and disposing of longhand paper ...
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ So how do I connect the 'disposing' of longhand paper to 'the only thing that I can discern as non-enjoyable' aka. { 'ifs therapists landscape ban' vs. 'sleep doctor final verdict incoherence' }
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ Longhand Paper disposal starts with computer organisedness (sysadmin and making order in filesystem ...) ...

[>>> 1.1.] ^^ As I've said, if you start with chin-na book it's also not good ... because if it's 'only in your head' then it kind of seems that you have yes given up on martial arts entirely if before practicing any 'moves' (even the barely resembling some functional moves) you say 'you did enough, enough enough -- don't touch don't touch don't touch' and eventually just read read read and don't practice sh*t ==> So here is probably is tai-chi book (where at least you 'dance out' some martial arts elements) is 'best bet' ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ Apparently with 'dancing out' 'martial moves' there's no 'don't touch don't touch don't touch' immediately firing before even starting ... but rather lets me finish the 'dance out' ... at least _something_ that is not _entirely in the head_ ... 
[@ ^ 2.1.] ^^ Still haven't figured this out yet ...

[@ ^ 3.] ...

[@ ^ 3.] Cults books
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Нету места мне в мире этом и по всему этому израилю миша меня опередил по всему израилю поверх и поперек. Не нахожу себе места в мире проклятом этом после того как сотворили надо мной что сотворили.
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Что бы Я не делал - как бы не извивлялся - мишин сын растет (и может еще там планируется ...) ... мщю ли Я -- помирился ли Я ... и не факт что у людей рождаются сыновья вообще -- после пяти дочерей итп ... 

[@ ^ 4.] Dating & Human-mating books (& grounding on them via mra documentaries and podcasts)
[@ ^ 4.1.] ^^ Иногда когда Я типа пребываю в состояниях что Я не вижу 'десяти-часовой стратегии вылеза' из состояния в котором Я сейчас нахожусь (типа один такой пример это когда в рестинг дей у тебя закрыт доступ к крипто-транзакзицям например (а так когда открыт доступ к таковым -- то вроде пока еще микро-апдейтс этого документа вместе там с сваппингом, ре-стейкингом, и говернанс-вотингом вроде пока 'держит' как 10-часовая стратегия вылеза из 'сумрачных состояний')) - то тогда в таких случаях может быть все-таки да прибегать и к таким мерам (по крайней мере это да работало 2022.11.06))
[@ ^ 4.1.1.] ^^ Рашионала она такая: (1) Что типа эирдроп хантинг - это хреновая, не-совсем-стабильная стратегия. (2) Индие-крипто лайфтайм нарратив - это более стабильная стратегия, но тут громадная пропасть которая 'всплывает' тогда -- что мне уже 44 почти и меня диким образом предала семья в том числе мой родной (!!) брат (!!) и так или иначе - половой орган есть и в нем так-же есть кровеносные сосуды. И так-или-иначе когда захочешь вернуться к 'более-стабильному программированию' (или учителю по программированию х/з) - то тогда так или иначе всплывает тема баб и позднего возраста.
[@ ^ 4.1.1.1.] ^^^ И поэтому - тогда чтобы заниматься тем-же самым 'нюхать' хоть как-то этот же самый 'более-стабильный' 'инди-крипто лайфтайм наррэйтиве' то нужно проходить через-эту-тему баб (что раскинь-или-прикинь несомненно травматично и несет с собой секондари эффектс само-по-себе).

[@ ^ 8.] Crypto technology books (tbd1)
[@ ^ 8.1.] ^^ Crypto that you don't talk about is a great 'psychological' and 'fragmented psyche' helper tool (think having a large 'bonding leverage' for 'lipton tea' -- does that affect 'psyche fragmentation' or not (in a sense of having a 'cohesive singular identity')?) ... so crypto technology books help in many ways for example how to store those money more safely ... in which blockchain? In which pow blockchain of all pow blockchains?   
[@ ^ 8.2.] ^^ In some days you can't do 'crypto transactions' ...
[@ ^ 8.3.] ^^ Bridge 3h punishment is a 'lesser bottomless pit' than more major cults out there but again a big bonding leverage can absolutely 'prolong' the '3h punishment' buffer ... in a sense that if '3h punishment is still not enough for you for self-accountability' then you could bond some secret sum of money if you have such sum ... and 'prolong that 3h punishment buffer' and thus come out as a yes 'accountable' person in society you reside in ...
[@ ^ 8.3.1.] ^^ Again without knowing the technology behind it ... crypto is a 'ghost city' for outside investors who just fomo into bitcoin and ethereum ... so you are with your current knowledge are alot like them compared to e.g. some smart contract and/or blockchain concensus dev who knows all concensus mechanisms and all smart contract langs and their 'buffer overflow' hack schemes that are more present in one smart contract language and less present in another ... it's like someone who doesn't do programming much won't know the need for typesafe programming and checking errors at compile time via more tighter contract programming versis less tight as c does it (it just says 'void*' parameter and idk what you pass to me therefore resulting in unforseen errors of 'programmer who forgot')
[@ ^ 8.5.] ^^ In a sense, 'indie-crypto lifetime narrative' elo is yes 'overwhelm' (of an 'unknown kind') whilst 'cryptocurrency elo rating' is not an overwhelm (?) ... and within 'cryptocurrency elo rating' ==> probably 'books' are bigger than ('>') 'farming' (e.g. are higher on 'elo rating') ...
[@ ^ 8.6.] ^^ Reason: Reading crypto technology books help with 'crypto [<script name='nosurf'>makeQuizElem2('bm9zdXJm','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] breach' aka the [<script name='r/nosurf'>makeQuizElem2('ci9ub3N1cmY=','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] hole that crypto [<script name='creates'>makeQuizElem2('Y3JlYXRlcw==','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] (additional lottery-chance 1000$ a year is not worth the r/nosurf hole breach).
[@ ^ 8.7.] ^^ Reason: Compared to 'crypto developer googler' - if you know sound fundamentals of many blockchains could have an edge, when you're amidst a 'coding war' and don't have much time for 'theory' just like knowledge of 'hennessy patterson' book could give an edge, hypothetically, compared to some non-knowledgeable integrity programmer (of the same 'photogenic rating') ... (just trying to come up with reasons here to battle madness of my life situation, sorry!)

[@ ^ 14.] CPTSD Books ('serial humilation')

[@ ^ 28.] Programming books are very powerful because the notion of 'the less code -- the more secure the money' -- you harvested from them (tha programming books) ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Whatever ... and how does that help me? That I should root in programming books? After watching programming documentaries? Memrise.com? Tm-srs? (?)

[#] Misc Notes - Distress Books - Finding Your Place Within Books amidst Mental Fog -- Keeping Track ('books fasting')

Preamble section (or whatever it's called ...):

[>] ^^ 'Statistics on paper' vs. 'statistics in the head' ...

[>] ^^ Track where you _stopped_ yesterday within a specific book and/or 'book category' ... or is there a 'fog'?
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Even if you didn't progress -- remember the place/context of where you picked up 

[>] ^^ When you can't discern between 'prison' and 'freedom' and even more so don't care about { 'ifs therapists ban' vs. 'euthanasia doctor's final verdict' } (aka 'when' 'death' is involved .. then I don't know definitely it has to be 'dry books' 'fasting' when 'death'/'looking too long into abyss' is involved ...

[>] ^^ The idea for this came from / when driving to shore border ... and the premise is such: if you could only 'find' your place in Jay Earley's IFS book (or his 'freedom from inner critic' book) and didn't progress with reading at all --> This doesn't necessarily mean, that 'you are faulty' it might just mean that 'some ifs concept that you've read about earlier, is still being internalized and after 2-3 weeks or months, you 'll be able to 'progress' a paragraph or two or more ... -- and you just need to keep checking, to not forget about ifs/cptsd/did/sokal-hoax/william-kingdon-clifford narrative) ... 
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ During periods of 'overwhelm' & 'burnout' at least do not forget about 'narratives' via 'books' maybe overwhelm sometimes will recede and then you could progress again ...

[>] ^^ I think what keeps me to 'books' is that 'leverage trading practice mode on http://gains.trade ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Т.е. как та девочка которую 'насилуют' в деревне ... она 'хихикает' ну типа все 'классно, типа! а че!' .. а потом приходит домой -- входит в 'gains.trade' и говорит -- 'о, such a leverage-trading cheerleading friends I have ...' ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ So in a sense she doesn't, m, (r/mengetrapedtoo ('<cough>, <cough>, ;)')) understand on a 'surface level' that she is being abused .. but when she comes home -- she sees the 'results' on 'leverage trading shorts & long position & total balance' screen ... 

[>] ^^ Since there's 'information overload overwhelm' section in this document,, and 'crypto bonding leverage' is important to me .... ==> Hence this makes rationale for 'books fasting mode' .... (?)

==> Current book: [IFS Level 1 Program (e:\ebooks)] ==> IFS 2nd Edition
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ When you are abused by 'close family' (e.g. a davidx story about a girl who said it's ok to be raped by her father (men, by the way, get raped too)) or some 'big huge establishment' such as (government entity) -- what sometimes results is - not 'sadness' ... not 'depression' ... but rather 'D.I.D' ... and some people at academia have researched well how to operate within this phenomenon (which is even rejected by some part of society (possibly even intentionally, with an intent to gaslight and gain additional power))
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ So for us, reading 'ifs exam certification books' is something that we could more coherently talk with myself aloud when out and about (amidst aforementioned gaslighters, and lesserly be 'swept off our feet' by situational 'horrors' and 'disasters').
[@ ^ 2.] Poor you, ohh poor you ... you were looking for that 'rock-bottom' (cannot find myself where's the rock bottom) but the 'rock bottom' is within Nadine Lucas's Zoom Group (because of 'Evidence Flipping' 'Socially Proofed' knockos) ...

[>] Xiangqi - Chinese chess ==> Last Check: [2022.11.24 09:54, Lau: 2022.11.29 12:46]
[@ ^ 1.] Go is missing 'human element' (which might be important, or might not) ... chess is 'contaminated' because father could be a 'rapist' (?) (?) (?) or could be not ... so now it leaves 'second-complex deep-strategy game with 'human element' (aka. king & checkmate) in it ...
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ But again, it is lacking in 'technological tools' e.g. gradual texel-like engine, puzzles website, ...
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ But on the third hand, when you've read that someone read 'dictionary' in prison isolator cell ... maybe having a book and 6-graudalities engine & google is still better than that one ...
[@ ^ 1.] Current Book ==> https://www.xiangqi.com/help/pieces-and-moves,, H.T. Lau

[>] Chess Books (Use 'I lost/won him in chess so what ... but I still don't have 150 million $ in bitcoin/monero' excuse) ==> [2022.11.18 23:12]
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ If going to a chess teacher regularly (whatevers), then 'out of embarassment' -- to not be considered some 'dumdum' by him, you would be reading chess books and practicing.
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ You could choose baduk teacher, or xiangi teacher ... but most likely the scope/landscape of chess teachers that is most prevalent in israel - is chess teachers -- and if you think about winning somebody 5 times in a row ... then in practice for us, maybe chess and go and shogi and xiangqi are almost mostly the same thing, besides and in addition to the fact that 'chasing the most human complex game out there' is also given to various interpretations and 'jumping games' according to 'most recent' complexity research -- chess is still considered one of the strongest contenders for 'most complex ....'
[@ ^ 1.] If you win him in chess - use: 'I won a person in chess but that still doesn't change sh*t because I still don't have 150 million $ in bitcoin' excuse.
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ If you lose to him in chess - use: 'I lost in chess to a person but again this has still a very little relevance to his or mine bitcoin or monero balance (through either 'leverage trading' or 'being into bitcoin early' or 'luck' or whatever ...) ... excuse ... (to remove the 'overly emotional' component (or whatever (?) (?) (?))) (tbd1,,)
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ When you lose in chess to someone, ask how much bitcoin was lost by losing to him in chess? If the answer is 'negative' or 'zero' probably it's because 'trust gaining' and ''ganging up' with somebody' property of chess is more important or is longer lasting positive effect that outweighs the negative effect of 'pain of loss' that lasts usually for few days or weeks (compared to 'benefits' of actually playing chess or other 'lesser-trollable game' with someone (because it's lesser-trollable game it probably means that he has nowhere to 'escape' but 'confide' in you a little more (no, he's not 'trolling' ... hence he is trustworthy person (or something (I mean in regard to the 'why it's zero bitcoin lost' (or even a 'negative sum is lost') when 'lost in chess'))) ...
[@ ^ 3.] ^^ With chess you cannot 'silently blend in' ... with gobaduk probably more so ...

[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Amount of googlings is somehow important.
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ On one hand you say 'every five year old kid nowadays is a programmer, theoretically speaking' but what if you took 12 year old kid to code you a smart contract for a new 'leverage trading dex' (e.g. some sort of gmx.io clone ...) -- would you trust him with his code as much as you would trust me (aka 30-37 year/old me) with my code? And what's the difference then?
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ Probably one answer is that in some books he presents a lot of use cases where he stretches the importance of extensive unit tests -- something that 5-12 year old kid would barely do. (And there are some other aspects that differentiate a '5-10 year old kid' from a 'trustowrthy smart contract dev' and though one of them - is software engineering methodologies books, and ability to pinpoint to a hirer-boss from which book you took this and that workflow/methodic).

[>] Preamble: Q. What if I run out of books or movies on a cetain distress topic (e.g. women/mra)?
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ A1: I'm counting on endless stream of podcasts e.g. r/datingoverfifty themed and even from there I suppose you could harvest context for 'anti feminism legal self defense' in different shades and shapes.
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ Worst case re-read over-and-over (as if preparing to some 'eternal exam') via 1000 repetitions and spice it up with an endless stream of fiction books ...
[>>> 1.1.1.1.] ^^ In a sense, that, distress states are 1000x worse than 'ahh it's just sooo boring' states.

Q&A:
[>] Q. What are some examples of 'distress states'? (which I'm supposedly aiming to resolve via 'hmm,' 'distress books'?)
[>>> 1.1.] A1.1: Shame-induced self-harm polarisation (e.g. 'как ты смеешь показываться с таким лицом наружу вообще?') vs. 'coercion is 'felt' and is does require martial arts training' ..

[>] ^ Crypto Technology books (sometimes 'crypto cryto voice just won't 'let go' ...)

[>] ^ Baduk book (find where you stopped yesterday (or 5 days ago (if was 'extreme' distress' ...)))

Not distress books (and why not):

[>] ^^ IFS Books - the point being - is if you just 'found' where you were yesterday .. and didn't really progress -- that doesn't mean that ifs stuff is not being internalized! This stuff takes (might take) long to digest ... 
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Sometimes a question pops up: 'Which one of ifs books?' ==> In distress states sometimes you have 'limits problem' so it's Jay Earley Ifs Therapy ==> No bad Parts (Schwartz) ==> Frank Anderson (his 'Therapists' book) ==> Second Edition IFS Therapy by Schwartz ==> All 3 tomes of earley ==> Do not change this, only over-the-days! 
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ IFS Book gives context to chess (via nadine lucas group) and making it 'lesser bottomless pit' in 'chess & katrain player's glasses' (but only if you have those 'glasses' (and you have those glasses by pure incidence from 'interacting' with 'nadine lucas group' ('why don't he ever talk?' / 'Is he spying on us'? && echoline && xyk))

[>] ^ [MINECRAFT_FOR_100_BTC_1] Indie-Minecraft Theory books (OpenGL, C++, etc.) (?)

[>] Mantuba (dominic obrien) books (will cause fkn* overwhelms to boot)

[>] ^ Guitar and Piano books (need pc tweaking for that (?))

[>] [FICTION_BOOKS_1] Fiction books - if you 'feel bored' by author's verbal diarrhea - then write your own fiction novella ... or keep reading ... sometimes, in 'stuck' 'daytime' petah-tikva it's just so.

[>] Besides crypto-technology books .. probably also books that are related to 'distress coding around this very document' (some js/ts scripts that you wanted to write around this document, etc.)

Distress state transition (anomalies):

[>] Q. Sometimes I hear a voice 'tai-chi! tai-chi!' -- what do I do if I am in 'distress books' mode? How do I so-to-speak 'palpate' that 'ifs part' within that state? (Or should I just, m, 'let it yell and whateva!') ?
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ A1: Still, please remember that after 6PM till 4AM whether you've traveled to 'shore border' or you have not ... whether you've managed to not 'over-sleep' all that 6PM-4AM timespan (which happens sometimes too) ... that there's a slightly different 'distress books' mode for that time period which includes also (yeah, check below on that section, 'evening distress books',, tbd1)

[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ "I LOVE reframing these disorders as complex and even needed reactions to trauma, but I see a big problem in CPTSD communities ... I see a lot of black and white thinking, victim narrative, good vs bad, etc. [...] [torevise further, tbd1] [...] In the beginning, I thought CPTSD was the best diagnosis ever, because it stopped stigmatizing those with trauma and let the world know that it really wasn\u2019t our fault. But the longer I was stuck, the more I realized that the reason I loved it so much was it furthered reinforced the victim narrative in my head and that I was the \u201cgood guy\u201d while my abusers were \u201cbad guys.\u201d (I am not claiming anyone should forgive abusers. The healthiest thing imo would be to understand they are in the grey and view them with nuance, but still say they have no place in your life.) [...] This isn\u2019t fair, but it\u2019s the truth. It\u2019s why so many of us grapple with the abuse our parents places on us. Because we see that they were suffering, but that suffering does not negate toxicity. [...] I see a lot of people rejecting cluster b diagnoses and/or demonizing then. Those are OUR people. [...] It isn\u2019t fair, but if we want to heal we must take responsibility, accept who we are, and fight against this every day. It is not enough to reframe our experience with self love. We also must work on living with and loving others in healthy ways." [tbd1,,]

[>] Stephane/Dangeli ==> IFS is stephane, that has backup from academia ... this is important because sometimes it's 'shameful' to do stephane itself ... Jay Earley book has a note about 'opposite parts' [Chapter 5 ('becoming centered') ==> 'Other Ways To Unblend' ==> Finding an Opposed Part ==> (*1)]
[^ @ 1.] (*1) ^^ [Chapter 5 ('becoming centered') // 'Other Ways To Unblend' // Finding an Opposed Part ]  ==> """Look around inside for a part of you that is the opposite of the target part or a part that is in conflict with the target part. For example, Sheila might locate a part of her that wants harmony with her husband no matter what. [In addition to the part that is angry with her husband]. She would access that part and hear what it has to say. This would help her to realize that there is more to her than the Temper Tantrum Part. She would then find a place inside her that is neither the Temper Tantrum Part nor the Harmony Part. This is likely to be Self."""
[^ @ 1.1.] ^^ This is exactly the Stephane's 'complementary opposite tactic' that he describes right here!

[>] ^^ Sometimes a new disaster hits, and, what-to-do-what-to-do your money got stolen and hopefully you got yet 100$ in bitcoin so you hopefully found this one f*cking document amidst the catstrophe! ... So now since you know it's not a 'wild reality skew' but still intolerably hurts, and you do yes sense that one-time-dtao (not ddosing myself on paper with it every day) would be hopefully enough ... if not ... move them to everyday-page dtao ...

[>] ^^ Write amt of over the day samples near each dtao, ... so you could calculate via ((samples*current_amt) + new_dtao) / new_samples (where `new_samples = samples + 1` ...)

(even though 'rape in prison is yes 'enjoyable'' -- the {'ifs therapists landscape ban' vs. 'sleep doctor final verdict' in-between-chairs } is at least for now, still yet, just yet, is still yet - undesireable (in a sense of 'not enjoyable')

[@ ^ 2.] ^^ A1.2: It's more a 'service' than it's a 'life' because every single tiny mis-step of yours is harshly judged by media 'he smiled inappropriately' ... 'he made such and such inappropriate' 'woke' comment ... he insulted gays here and here ... '5 soilders dead in iraq' (while it was not specifically president's fault)
[@ ^ 2.1.] ^^ Most likely you are going to be in trial after your service as a president because most surely you have pissed a huge chunk of population by then (without even doing sh*t).
[@ ^ 3.] ^^ They might later, after your term, introduce the 'cutting' of the budged of allotted security personnel for past, former ex-presidents (wtf not?) and later you will have no protection from super-pissed people who you pissed during your presidency term whilst this wasn't even directly your fault (but some of your subordinates f*ckup) ... and now it's you who 'serve as a target' ...

[>] Q. Why, even though being a president is a sh*tty job - one should want to aspire to be a president?
[@ ^ 1.] A1: Because if he was that much schizophrenic (or simply very damaged in his brain), or 'black swan' enough, so, that only 'noting down top-of-the-mountain' on paper could snap him out of those horrid 'pinkness' states ... then obviously taking on being a president and eating criticism from everybody and his mother is a better option than staying schizophrenic without ability to 'climb out' and 'lost and confused to oblivion' ...
[@ ^ 1.1.] A1.2: ^^ Theoretically one could manage to be a 'very rich man' (aka. have president-grade luxury living accomodations) and yet both avoid 'public eye'/'public scurtiny' but again that's a matter of luck ('have best of both worlds') ...
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ A1.2.1.: In a sense, as a conclusion from the above notes, it's more of a 'run and hide' type of world ... more than it's 'what this world has to 'offer' to you' type-of-world ...

[#] Dtao - Overwhelming inner critic dtao -- Dealing with overwhelming inner critic via dtao instead of 'bashing' it (but it's relation with parents ...)

[##] Preamble 7 - : 

[>] ^^ The idea is to, is, instead when critic overwhelms me with fatalistic overwhelming messages -- instead of saying 'пошел ты нахуй собака проклятая, заеб*л уже!' и начинать гасить его в стиле 'если еще раз скажешь - подзатыльник въебу' -- то типа вместо этого предложить ему написать в процентах это на бумажке ... и через год выкинуть такие бумаги (потому что клог) (но отдельный листочек и сохранять его куда-то в пакетик) (но если заметки то писать на другом листе) ...

[>] ^^ Potential origin: This has started when visiting kanevsky once, and then I started incanting 'my brain works for my own benefit ... my brain works for my own benefit ...' (but possibly done tai-chi kata beforehand ... (so this might be a 'cross-section' between tai-chi and what kanevsky tried to 'drill in' via his 'reverse psychology' coersiveness etc.)))

[>] ^^ Incompleteness: Obviously this doesn't unburden the exiles ... just gives 'trailheads' ... so must obviously also in parallel read (or touch-read) Jay Earley's inner critic book ...

[#] Dtao - Frontal collision dtao (frontal collision with sanitars - dtao's) (but it's relation with parents ...)

[##] Preamble 15 - WTF Dtao (and when dtao is not needed):

[>] Q. So when dtao are not needed and when dtao are yes needed? ==> ?
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Or rather is there a situation possible when dtao is not needed? ==> So far I don't forsee (200k$ in crypto (?)) 

[>] First of all 'wtf dtao?' is a weird question in a sense, that this whole 'wtf parts' existence syndrome is the whole reason I needed dtao in the first place! But let's say this: if I'm being gaslighted and unable to do anything about it (either the gaslighting is 'too subtle' that the police cannot be 'activated' or the gaslighting is from a family member whose death I am afraid of as well, beside his/her horrific gaslights) - then dtao, makes the 'subtle' gaslighter - doubt his own perceptions then ... (because he's pummeled with a 'rhytm' of a confronting reality, to his 'thought up' reality).

[>] ^^ Again, one problem that I forsee is 'dtao limits problem' in a sense of ('how much dtao is enough?' 'where does it stop?' 'I could write 'what bad/what good' on every little emotional trauma which would result in a burnout (to write those every day ...)'

[>] ^^ Sometimes the gaslighter gaslights me so, that I even can't write dtao for days in which case we need either 'secret texel-only chess teacher' or 'secret ifs therapist' (the earlier probably the better because I don't give him a reason to reject me and yet I get deeper social proof, than just, m, clerks at the store that nod me with their heads) ... ==> How do I get there? G-d knows.

[>] ^^ So far, theoretically, how much dtao I can survive? 10? 20? 100? ==> Work on testnets in parrallel to it. When you have 200k$ in 'secret crypto' there's a correlation - I wrote above.
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Again, maybe because, then a gaslighter could subtly 'smell' your 'lawyer hiring ability' ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Again, remember to plan the pomodoro steps, before actually doing them (this definitely seems more 'sterile' and 'less jerky') ...
[>>> 1.2.] ^^ Hope again that I could somehow figure out how do I come to a texel-only chess teacher. (?)

[>] Basically, the beginning of dtao is something like 'wgwaw/wbwaw' and 'w(hat)g(ood)j(enny)s(tay)/w(hat)b(ad)j(enny)g(one)' because this is a one sure polarisation that never gets resolved because you can't fully 100% control her brain (and it 'branches out' from there) ...

[##] Preamble 26 - additional 'inner physics' in regard to dtao:

[>] [PAPER_VS_COMPUTER_1] Dtao that is on the paper - is a burnout -- because people will see and start doing 'witchery' but on the other hand, if, you're lost in filesystem on where to write dtao ... then probably it should be 'migrated' to paper again ...

[##] Preamble 36 :

[>] Those are not like in the previous section, which are about: 'Overwhelming inner critic dtao' ... those ones are to do with 'father polarization' that I'm not able to resolve due in time (see that section also)

[>] So far hard cap: encoded dtao on paper negligified considering to 'second hospitalization' ...

[>] Either it's 'parents' abandonment & denouncement' ('бес вселился в голову') <or> it's with uprise of internet they got 1000x more powerful <or> it's my zygomatic/c.t. that disables me to discern what the f*ck is really going on ... (this def. seems crazy).

[##] Onwards 1.1:

[>] I'm in 'rape in prison enjoy' state ==> I don't even _object_ to some 'additional tests' that 'those people' in psych ward will do to me ... in fact - I'd rather _enjoy_ it ... ==> Guess is -- that trauma is so deep and the unblending work that is needed is so f*cking massive, that not sure that during lifetime, less to say during father constrained-time that he wishes for -- will I be able to unblend those ... ==> so this is like a lottery -- will they hospitalise? won't they hospitalise? -- it's really a 'lottery-grade' question ==> So now, when I'm thinking about describing that very situation to him, and asking him for further help, to give me more time for unblending self-work, to avoid the aforementioned hospitalisation ==> thinking of asking him for further help results in me getting vibes like 'это будет ошибка, идиот!' from my parts (that are probably blended in some clusterfuckiada, ==> parts don't realise though, that actually the hospitalisation (and not their 'это будет ошибка, идиот!' objection) is the one, that will fuck me up even thousand millions times more ==> , that after it - I'll get tens of thousands of more parts and complexities and complications ==> won't be able to get to my 8-9k$ after even 5-6 years (or will need 80-300k$ after 'second hospitalization') ==> So then again here question comes to: ==> so parts tell me 'это ошибка, идиот!' невзирая на предстоящую катастрофу ==> (tbd1,,)

[>] ^^ Due to 'virulent & cautistic' cptsd critic that keeps acting 'pervasively' (no disrespect), thought of devising the following dtao: how bad is to 'talk to father about chess' in perspective of (amidst impending danger of) 'second psychiatric hospitalization' ... ==> so like:

[#] Dtao Q & A - (tbd1,,)

[>] Q. What are the three main components of dtao?
[@ ^ 1.] A1: Dtao has 3 components, { 'tai-chi' & 'shibashi' } && { 'chess & tetris-attack & story-based rpgs' } && { stephane varlakova and ifs } which means that supposedly ifs book could help with dtao stuckness? (?) (?) (?) 
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ It's important to read 'did book' after 'ifs book' for 'grounding' ... so far the perespectives for becoming an ifs therapist are dim.
[@ ^ 2.] A1.2: ^^ Dtao, if needed, has 3 components: shibashi/tai-chi/<unclear if chin-na verification is 100% always needed>,, chess && tetris attack,, stephane && varlakova ...

[>] Q. Is there always going to be a need for dtao? Do dtao (theoretically, not from 'lazyness'/'burnount'/'overwhelm' perspective) ever end?
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Basically there's always going to be a need for dtao: either it's wgwaw/wbwaw (reproductory hyper repression, penis is a blood organ) or a 'medusa wife whom you cannot control her brain' (wgj(enny)s(tay)/wgj(enny)g(one)) ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ So it's like what? Either you're slacking on it and then you're in the 'realm of hungry ghosts'? (?)
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ You haven't read 'freedom from inner critic' book 3 times yet, so { 'inner-critic-overwhelm' ==> dtao } is the only one to sustain autonomy/agency insofar, in that regard, until you fully know all the 'criticised child' unblending recipes by mouth, etc.

[>] Q. Does tetris attack is any important? (because it's not a 'lesser-trollable-game'?) (tbd1,,)
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Helps discern dubious ChatGPT output, as you train yourself on 'pattern matching' ...
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ Helps spot 'security incidents' on 'infected laptop'/'crypto laptop' and outside of it ... (pattern matching tuning) (but it will make you spot huge depressions too, so { piano & guitar & drawing & journey games } might help in conjunction with it)
[@ ^ 3.] ^^ Help spot 'brain dead' mint-a-testnet-nft opportunities sometimes online ...

[>] Q. Piano and guitar also somehow helps with dtao - how?
[@ ^ 1.] Helps with 'paper mundanity' or 'filling paper nomenclature' burnout.
[@ ^ 2.] Helps survive demonic exiles.
[@ ^ 3.] 'Wtf have you told' critic is a 'chess loss' and/or 'multiple chess losses' to father ... and to vent chess losses, piano, and, [can't ask for money for normal gaming pc, so then resort to gacha's all over again] gacha games, and guitar are indicated ... (guitar and piano in themselves are not a burnout nor they are an overwhelm). So swallow them with gay pride! A-men!
[@ ^ 3.] Survive 'lost in bypassing women's eye contact' states on the way to 'free-to-yell' zone (which somehow, after few hours, cause me neurotics, if they don't 'notice' something in my looks and they start giving me 'mean, inquiring looks' that puzzles me (dudes, or womenz, whoever you are --- I'm just a f*cking immmigrant not everyone had 10 years in his life to play guitar! (But I get mean looks like this is something I was supposed to know from before I was even born - looks)) ... point being ... I'm 'trauma unresponsive' sometimes, and there's definitely some sort of 'government-backed feminist nonsense overwhelm' going on ... so this tactic somehow switches something in their brains ... (because they flock to live music shows) ...
[@ ^ 4.] ^^ Guitar && Piano help with 'все из рук вон падает' / 'все из рук валится вон' state(s) ... in a sense that when you play on the guitar or piano ... after a few notes of 'no flow' aka absolutely hitting the wrong notes (aka. 'wild incoherence') ... some part gets 'activated' that say's 'wtf how come?' and then you like 'no sh*t I can do it!' and then you try and hit the right notes and reduce rhythm, until you can hit a few notes in succesion for one or two minutes or so ... and that's called 'grounding' via 'yousician'. But again, how do you _get_ to piano and guitar in the first place? And why piano? or guitar for that instance? Why pick them as a metaphorical 'needle in a haystack' and not something else? Maybe they are related to 'playing go with ifs therapists' as go is 'game of setting even sturdier boundaries' (and there are boundaries with every man, including ifs theapists) and then 'venting losses' in the game of go? (?)
[@ ^ 4.] tbd1,,

[>] Q. Game of GO and dtao?
[@ ^ 1.] Game of GO is a game of de-facto building sturdy boundaires with your opponent ... and we've already determined, via mp-3mp-apr that even between two-three most powerful presidents there are boundaries henceforth there's no man that 'has no boundaries with any other man' (or he is just L.O.S.T. (and probably gonna 'get some' unexpectedly (?))) and let's say solving go puzzles helps you regain that sense of boundaries (there are other methods of course like 'asking your protectors 1000's of questions' and more, but this one is also might be useful for sensing one's boundaries (that always exist))
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ You could think of shavit fragman's baduk club (which exists with real people) and study go and 'sense boundaries' like that ...
[@ ^ 2.] There are boundaries with ifs therapists (as there are always boundaries between any two males (see mp-3mp-apr))

[>] Q. What happens if I run out of sw ideas? (tag: out_of_ideas_tag_1,,)
[@ ^ 1.] Minecraft: android minecraft, single-db minecraft, search within minecraft signs, encrypted minecraft signs, portals (to different worlds),,
[@ ^ 2.] Worst come to worst: Connect 'ideas' to 'indie-crypto-narrative' in a sense that 'write a better arbitrage bot' or something that, m, doesn't involve 'needing to hire people' but eventually will 'run out' only when you get 150 million $ ...

[>] Q. What are some systematic & methodological supplementary activities to dtao? (that could/should needed to keep dtao 'flow'?)
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Grounding with Shibashi - Tai-Chi - Chin-na - Bjj book (even though I'm doing, m, photoshops of the video sequence, nevertheless still ...)
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ Skimming over 'dtao-grade notes from the past few days' (in diary)
[@ ^ 3.] ^^ Getting out to 'free-to-yell' zone (tai-chi is one of 3 components of dtao, and it raises 'demonic emotions' && 'demonic yells' and 'yelling' at home will produce additional 'side effects' that could even make me 'spill' my 'passwords' aloud (and more)) (early dementia? (?) (but still 'autonomy && agency' (?) (and needing '8-9k$' vs. 'needing 100k$' after potential 'rape in prison' -- discernance ...) ...)) ...

[>] Q. Why do people become a president? After all it's a shitty job (jokes always told about you, headaches that people whom you accidentally killed will come after you somewhere in the future, etc.)
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ A1: Or wife will divorce and find herself a 'better man'.

[##] Misc notes - tosort ...

[>] [DTAO_AND_COMPUTER_SECURITY_1] ^^ So, now, I want to be 'comfortable' even on an 'infected laptop' (some of my family members are tech-savvy) ... to be able to write 'dtao' ... so henceforth a 'pomodoro' research into 'ransomware' && 'keyloggers' && 'extreme privacy' && 'identity theft' landscape (as an observer) is somewhat correlated to dtao (?)

[#] Misc Notes - Coding around this document - as a supposedly-distress activity 

Preamble:
[>] ^^ Sometimes perpetuals-trading still 'slips in' (and it happens f*cking impulsively! (e.g. yesterday 800$ with solana out-of-the-blue (and it was f*cking luck that I could get out of it ... it immediately went downslope immediately after)).

[>] ^^ Pay attention to 'distress books' as much as possible ...

[>] ^^ Off-shadow trading by 'coding' micro, but useless features around/for/about this document ... just for the sake of coding and steering off perpetuals leveraged trading. If I wrote some useless feature at least I 'killed time' and yet though not lost money like SBF (who leverage-traded FTT? (?))

[>] ^^ Remember that there's 'scripts/utils-staging.js' for in some states when you code, you sometimes get 'delayed' on some other 'perpetuals' screen when switching alt-tab ... 

[>] Leverage/derivatives trading or simply trading of any kind will definitely make 'programming in distress' impossible, because you will be compulsively switching to that trading screen, when switching alt-tab ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ And this document both relies on existence of $100 in bitcoin and also 'coding minecraft' (which was just made impossible, via leverage trading screen comulsive checking).

Warmups (considering its a distress):
[>] Making order in filesystem ...

[>] Reading js/ts books (because the coding is around this document, not 'reactos') ==> Not sure ... whether it will 'blow' or not ...

[>] Again, reminding here -- to read blockchain technology books. (?)

[>] Reminding: chess & baduk books ..

[>] Book: Shibashi book for, m, 'extremely noting' the 'shame-overdose-induced' 'self-harm'

[>] Getting back onto favoxil or at least ruminating about buying it (bridge just didn't 'fly' (for many reasons including 'Jay Wacker'))

[>] Throwing paper (and possibly into the water too) -- when you meet 'complex problems' (b/c 'programming puzzles' sometimes are more 'complex' then some menual, repetitive work such as 'do 5 repetitive swaps on 3 wallets') ==> You write them on paper ==> Sometimes personal stuff 'slips' in there too ... ==> So maybe would be useful to dispose of it from prying eyes.

[>] Book: Tai-chi book for 'not giving up entirely on martial arts narrative' ==> does it belong here or not?
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Like we said, with 'most-likely-corrupt-policemen-involved type of coercion' you could, m, easy talk about 'katrain' and then your 'maintaining same elo level with katrain goes: 'boom!' ...' ... ==> So there's obviously always is a rationale for 'not giving up entirely on martial arts narrative' (and there weren't for 'shame-overdose-induced self-harm' ....) ...

Knocking neighbors (since we had to bring up 'coding' ==> now knocking neighbors theme is 1000x relevant): ==> Moved all to 'knocking\_neighbors\_1,,' section (at next sunday ...) ...

Warmups that probably won't work in here (distress):

[>] Book: What about 'innocence project' books? ==> do they belong here or not? ==> For now moved to 'warmups that probably won't work'.

[>] Minecraft book - even though ...

[>] Reactos book - far from 'coding around this document'

<div hidden>tag: knocking_neighbors_tag_1,, </div>
[#] Misc Notes - Knocking Neighbors - trying to be constructive / trying to stay indifferent ...

[>] Q. Why are knocking neighbors are not the 'sole cause' of all my problems?
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ A1: Because at least, from a 'logical' perspective their sole 'influence' cannot extend towards bney brak, and then, somehow, suddenly and aburptly terminate/stop at 'ramat-gan--bney-brak' boundary ... there's clearly something else is at play here (not their sole knocks of those sole particular specific instance of specific apppartment inhabitants).

[>] Q. What is the relation between 'knocking neighbors' and 'ramat-gan--bney-brak' boundary?
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ A1.1: Соседи они конечно же собаки потому что например они не мой учитель по джиу джитсу ... но они это не 'самое зло' что есть здесь ... то есть есть над ними 'домнирующий' кто-то или 'что-то' ... и убеждаясь что вдруг перебираясь через границу 'рамат-ган--бней-брак' ответ на вопрос 'do I enjoy being raped in prison?' резко вдруг изменяется с "yes, I do!" на "the hell I don't!" ... -- ... и подтверждая свою гипотезу что соседи это не 'самый-корень-зла' а есть еще над ними какой-то 'повыше' доминирующий над конкретно мной 'корень зла' -- это позволяет мне не спускаться на 'собачий уровень' самих соседей -- засчет одной поездки на 20 км 'влево' (если она конечно-же возможна (immigration to ramat-aviv was a matter of luck!')) -- great bang for the buck!
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ 'Спускаться на собачий уровень' это опять же может казаться как что-то желаемое если ты 'enjoy rape in prison' и единственное что мы пока нашли это сказать себе что последствие rape-in-prison может потребует с меня потом через 5-6 лет 100k$ bonding-leverage for lipton tea,, вместо 8-9k$ и так как Я потел с этими эирдропами -- то это 'ощутимо' ... и надеемся что майнинг-кард здесь не накроется! (тоже очень страшно!!!)

[>] Q. What is the relation of knocking neighbors to 'donkey! donkey!' joke?
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ A1.1: Как в анекдоте 'козел! козел! --> сам ты козел! --> Буууууууммммммммм!'
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ Что типа из далекого прошлого х/з помню что типа когда слишком сильно двигают диванами - это значит что меня ждет что-то на примере 'unexpected bad surprise' в плане того что что-то тривиальное такое да пролетит: или в субботу останусь без продуктов питания, или выеду наружу без заряженного телефона, без туалетной бумаги в сумке (которую туда вчера хотел положить еще), без заряженного велосипеда ... итп ... странная вещь ...
[>>> 1.1.1.1.] ^^ Будем честны с собой - 'странная' 'дименция' ... в таких-или иных дозах у меня все-таки наблюдается -- как не стыдно это признать!!! (A voice says that might be related to 'limits problem' ('starky out!'))

[##] Reasons to avoid any 'confronting' thoughts against neighbors whatsoever (beyond considering them 'slightly exaggerated environmental noise' that nothing can be done about)

[>] If you're fighting on 'metaphysical level' (as opposed to chess/xiangqi/shogi) -- you are always, always going to lose (99.99999...9999999%)

[##] Why do they bother me? (posed as an 'open--abstract-thinking--question') (see though above reasons to avoid 'confronting thoughts')

[>] Sometimes with excessive knocking I'm saying my passwords (!!) aloud (!!) ... 
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ So then maybe michael bezzel book is more important then ever!

[>] Кто-то (и Я не хочу указывать конкретно пальцем) 'триангулируется' на мой 'диапазон мышления' и начинает 'потюкивать' (или содавать какой-то фоновой шум (типа окно хлопнуло вдруг со страшной силой или отркылось слишком резко итп.)) раз-в-пять-минут ... и как 'второстепенный' эффект после таких ритмичных 'постукиваний' вдруг у меня создается желание послать резко в 'r/cults' какой-то ответ от 'chatgpt' и собственно не подождать один день ... а сразу рывком неостановимым послать -- и ничего вообще то в этом страшного и нет -- но только вот бесконтроль мешает в состояниях когда нужен 'trauma grounding' ... 
[^ @ 1.] ^^ Просто найти какое-то место максимально рядом с домом где нету с прохожими 'eye contact innuendos with random bypassers' и также там естественно и отсутствуют те-же вышеупомянутые (на которых конкретных челов Я не хочу указывать пальцем) постукивания по природе вещей (ну если нету конечно дрона (a flying drone) надо мной) ... и подышать глубоко пять-десять раз.

[>] I'm about to note something down -- then I hear a few 'drags' -- and then boooom -- forgot (what I wanted to write).

[##] Trying to stay indifferent:

[>] They cannot be the 'cause'
[>] Frame them as 'environmental noise' (and 'seeing' beyond that -- is just looking into the abyss (just like it is with 50-to-80 years old 'old age' suicide reframe went ...)) ...
[@ ^ 1.] ^ That suicide reframe went like this: Old Age ==> So you'll live a shorter life, let's say 50 instead of median 80 ... not thinking about 'longer but more sh*tty life' (because that's 'looking into the abyss') ...
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^ Same is with knocking neighbors ... 

[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Remember they have infinite monero balance and they are checking their stiffledness every 5 minutes.

[>] So let's say they are checking their stiffledness every five minutes ... but you need to be either super-ultra rich to do that (so probably they have 'tons of money in monero')
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Maybe that way by assuming that no one knows how much money the other one got in monero, I could maintain a somewhat survivable boundary with them? (?)

[>] Представь что человек (какой-то душевный инвалид или пенсионер) сидит на стуле 24 часа у себя в квартире (или это женщина-инвалидка или пенсионер) и у него 'нервозный рефлекс такой' что он тихо сидит и вообще типа замкнутый такой почти ни с кем не разговаривает но раз в 1-2 минуты он просто обязан подвинуть стул на котором он сидит. Типа злиться на нервозные порывы такие или на людей которые вот в таком состоянии находятся -- бессмысленно. Типа че ты на него срывайся не срывайся он всеравно будет двигать стулом своим раз в 5 минут. Хоть ты его дубинкой поколоти. Всеравно он пока не умрет - будет продолжать раз в 5 минут двигать свой сидетельный стул. Побьешь его дубинкой -- он впадет в обморок -- очнется --- и всеравно через пять минут начнет опять двигать стул. И сага продолжается (?)

[>] [RAMAT_GAN_BNEY_BRAK_BOUNDARY_IF_1] Knocking neighbors do not drive with me to { 'bney-brak' <--> 'ramat-gan-boundary' } every day (so in that sense they are not the only culprit (in a sense of 'corrupt-police-involved-here' coercion.))

[>] [ABOVE_FIVE_SENSES_1] It is possible that some coercion that I'm feeling is beyond auditory/visual/olfactory/kinesthetic (not included here 'taste') - senses ... e.g. not 'knocks' nor anything I 'see' either ... it's just some sort of a 'gut feeling' but beyond auditory/visual/olfactory/kinesthetic senses ... that yes does 'coerce me' but not through something that I can see/hear/smell/sense-via-a-touch (I mean we're going off-grids here but, the point that I'm making is that sometimes when I'm getting mad at knockos -- I definitely had moments and 'ifs parts' saying to me -- that I did wrong by doing so (by reacting angrily onto them (in a sense that, m, if someone yells 'goat! goat!' and you 'react angrily to him' then you might not see the real goat later.)))

[>] [YOU_ARE_GONNA_LOSE_1] If you're fighting on a 'metaphysical level' most likely you are going to lose. Because the battle is not 'well-defined'. Where is loss? Where is a 'win'? ==> Sooo ==> you're gonna lose 99.999% (e.g. some example would be probably: 'interstellar shove into the abyss scene' (?) (I'm just speculating here, sorry...)).

[>] [TRAIN_TO_BUZAN_1] Knocking neighbors are 'psychotic women' (like in 'train to buzan' movie) ==> Yelling at them is like 'evil begets evil' ==> What would happen if he'd yell at that woman in 'train to buzan'? ==> That would just make her more furious ...

[##] Some 'ramat aviv lucky imigrant''s obsever-style notes on their motivations ...

[>] Knocking neighbors - they gaslight. They check their 'stiffledness' every 5 minutes (every tiny so-called 'vibration' can be sensed) and then they 'gaslight' the surrounding environment (by making a random loud, unpredictable sound) 
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Question is - where they get the social proof to keep gaslighting so it's either from some place, or their relations with the hood' homies' and all my homies were left in mytishi so I'm out of ammo.
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ Q. What are their motivations? ==> Some corrupt cop wants an appartment nearby him for his son. 

[>] 'Freedom fighters' ... they check their stiffledness every five minutes or so ... and then, wtf, do they 'break out of their comfort zone'  (so hence the name 'freedom fighters' ...) ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ How they break out of their 'comfort zone'? Via doing randomised noises thus gaslighting the whole surrounding environment. (?) (What tyler called 'unstiffling' is more like 'gaslighting' ... seems to me)

[#] Misc notes: Zyogmatic Shame Factor Amortizers

[>] Preamble maintain 'katrain elo' ==> ... still, under enough physical threat coercion you could theoretically speak about anything ... including katrain ... even about katrain and then pfffft ==> gone your 'elo' like it did with chess ... ==> Visitin various gps locations sometimes helps snap out of that everpresent, unbeatable, invincible 'sense' of 'coercion' ==> Visiting various gps locations has sometimes 'shame factor' problem (e.g. 'как ты смеешь показываться с таким уродливым лицом наружу, собака проклятая!' ==> [which eventually in 'extreme doses' leads to] ==> 'self harm') ==> But again studing martial arts, before moving gps between various gps locations, after that 'photogenic face destruction' ostrov-movie-grade mistake, or doing any martial arts activities before 6pm does/will accentuate that 'shame factor' by a factor of 10x ==> causes you to want self-hospitalise a few days after (?)) ==> ^^ So I made another section called 'zygomatic shame factor amortizers - try 1' (?) (and here we are) (torevise, tbd1)

[>] Amortizers: guitar, piano, faucets, studying foreign languages (somehow, or anyhow) (?)
[@ ^ 1.] Faucets (with prelude-leading to 'incentivized testnets') ==> A very potent shame factor amortizer,, but, ==> not possible at weekends, a rabbithole of its own (airdrop farming is like f*cking gambling)
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ But if you _just_ _have_ a somewhat substantial sum of funds, e.g. 8k-9k$ funds, they somewhat help you even during resting days if you don't touch them ...
[@ ^ 1.2.] [BLOCKCHAIN_TECHNOLOGY_BOOKS_1] ^^ Reading 'blockchain technology' books && 'nosurf' books ==> are they in themselves, are a 'shame factor amortizer'? Or not?
[@ ^ 2.] Guitar ^^ ==> Impossible to reach? (?)

[>] I want to be able to do tai-chi kata at/after 6PM so I could when instantly jumped outside - have a vacant places outside (in a sense that, this is not the first time this happens and most likely _will_ happen) and it's more like 'insanity' is 'doing the same thing and expecting a different result' thing ...

[@ ^ 2.] ^^ Typical problems when I get outside during the morning: 
[@ ^ 2.1.] ^^ Getting dragged to doing another chore during the evening 'gotta gotta gotta' - which causes a 'smoking overdose' the next few days.
[@ ^ 2.2.] ^^ Undesire/unwillingness after sitting in the bushes, to come back to knockorro noise during the day resulting in over-stuckness in the bushes and/or some sort of 'being stuck for hours without drink/food/or a toilet paper/charged phone' ... (because the other part just will protest and won't come back ...) ...  
[@ ^ 2.2.1.] ^^ During the evening there's no problem coming back to 'knockorrro noise' from the bushes (because they lay to sleep at ~11-12PM like an ordinary adjusted-in-israel people ...) ...

[>] ^^ Favoxil was better ==> Get back to favoxil. It wasn't your 'choice' anyway ... or was it? When you are unknowledgeable and are doing something 'let's see what this switch flip will do' and then things blow up -- it was not your 'choice' per-se now was it?

[#] Misc Notes - ELO Ratings besides katrain/mom/civ/tetris-attack

[>] ^^ So, if we're talking about 'maintaining existing elo levels' - then are there 'elo levels' of: Foreign & Spoken languages knowledge? Of Guitar & Piano knowledge/skill? Of Drawing? Of Tai-chi? Of Programming? Rpg story/journey games? ==> Moved to separate section ...
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ If something goes wrong (it did happen once - with 'ifs elo') -- go back / retract to 'maintaining the same elo level with katrain' - it still works ...
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Drawing - probably not (as there is very little 'competition context') ...
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ We need/want that for 'bjj & chin-na' spindown as seemingly just katrain/mom/civ/tetris-attack just don't seem to 'cut' it on their own alone-wise ...
[@ ^ 3.] ^^ It seems that tai-chi (aka. 'martial arts meditation' (as opposed to yoga, which is a 'postures' meditation)) is a 'part of' maintaining same elo level with 'bjj&chin-na'? E.g. 'do at least some 'farthest resemblance' movement? (?) (?) (?)
[@ ^ 3.1.] ^^ Or maybe I'm wrong? (?) (?) (?)
[@ ^ 3.1.1.] ^^ There's no 'maintaining the same elo level with tai-chi kata' because tai-chi is the actually one from which the whole idea of 'keeping _at least_ the same elo level with katrain' hyper-focus came from ... in a sense that it says ... 'at least don't lose martial arts at all if you have bjj painful fracture ... because martial arts are _so_, _so_ important' and 'probably self-rehearsed 'mostly theoretical only' chin-na is better than no chin-na knowledge altogether, even theoretical' from that 'at least don't lose martial arts entirely' probably came the understanding: 'don't lose katrain entirely' ... ==> so supposedly copy-catting chin-na as per jwing ming's books & dvd's (you have both, also for martial applications of it) supposed to 'keep' that 'elo' 'hyper-focus' ==> So I suppose what it should be is: 'copy-catting chin-na and it's martial applications as perfectly as possible' and the best you can make of it ==> Try 'trembling' for it ... who knows ... ==> tbd1,,
[@ ^ 4.] [IFS_1] ^^ Is there 'maintaining the same ELO' with ifs? ==> Seems like not so it means that ifs is a 'bottomless pit' yet in some certain situational overwhelm situations it is very useful... and there are a lot of overwhelming situational situations in certain specific GPS locations ... ==> tbd1,,
[@ ^ 4.1.] ^^ Also: ifs is not a bottomless pit in a sense that if a specific individual is in some cult (or jumping between cults) ... then ifs provides an 'academically-refined' cult which is a 'less' 'bottomless pit' than some other 'cults' that exist out there ... due to 'academia-peer-review' property of it ...,, but still tbd1
[@ ^ 4.1.1.] ^^ So in a sense ifs is not a 'bottomless pit' but rather is a 'lesser' 'bottomless pit' which is good for segments of population who reside in a 'bottomless pit' (e.g. cults followers who do not realise and/or blackout within them, the harmful effects of their cults)...
[@ ^ 6.] ^^ Is there 'elo level' regarding 'digital minimalism' and 'extreme privacy' (a.k.a. michael bezzel? (?)) ==> Apparently can't touch that because moving to ramat aviv is on a 'higher note' than 'worrying about extreme privacy' because if I'm not 'careful' then the whole shebang of being near 'internet' & 'privacy' could be 'taken away' from me ... so it's secondary unfortunately (and things will inevitably 'spill' the painful ones which shouldn't ...)
[@ ^ 6.1.]
[@ ^ 7.] ^^ Just curious - is there 'elo level' with bridge? ==> Well yep if you sit 3h bridge marathon with Oren Lidor and/or Doron Yadlin -- you will either score less or score more or equal -- and that determines your elo level compared to them ... 
[@ ^ 7.1.] ^^ This elo level is rather 'sparse' compared to chess e.g. statistical-rather but in overall sense if you run 10-days marathon against one of them ... then their { (1) Memorisation of bidding language. (2) Knowledge to recognise of signals when playing hand. (3) A little bit of algorighmic thinking of how to play and what not to play depending on what partners played (but this algorithmic thinking is much less 'deep' than chess) (4) ? } ==> will to a large extent determine whether they win or a lose in points in that 10 days marathon. But then again, this is not a 'measure' of anything ... e.g. their algorithmic thinking might be more 'mediocre' than a chess player ... their 'language of bidding' knowledge -- might be due to them having inherited that from their rich parents from childhood ... just like french was a language of 'high circles' in some non-french societies ... but again the purpose of this is mostly about not the 'elo' but rather having some sort of alternate venue of connecting with people / making connections with people ... but then again ... this is not the sole way of making connections ... and it's possible that existence of interconnected internet has made this 'bridge' lucrativity even more obsolete ... as one could simply invest in making an arbitrage bot and blow all the bridge people out of the water ... I mean in a sense that 'bridge' was some sort of 'gamble-pointing of a finger' when you were out of options ... and so you saw e.g. some ad in tel-aviv university sports club and thought: ha! this must be it! ... but it is very possible that for example working with parts and interrogating them with protector questions ... in retrospect ... wouldn't bring you to any 'bridge' seeking altogether. E.g. in a sense of: nothing's broke -- don't apply any sort of 'band-aid' on top of it ... it's like more like carrying some notion of 'if it's all so seemingly 'too calm'' then 'add even more overwhelm on top of it' -- 'and then it all will become clear!' sort of mindset .. which might in retrospect not overwhelm -- the already overwhelmed & mega-traumatised system.
[@ ^ 7.1.1.] ^^ When nobody talks ... there's not to 'bring yourself to people' to cause additional overwhelm on the system, that might in fact, be traumatised and needed more of that ramat aviv immersion ...
[@ ^ 7.1.1.1.] ^^ Probably even 4.30 wouldn't exist and many things wouldn't exist should I have known about 'nonsense lana physicist' much earlier on.
[@ ^ 7.1.1.1.1.] ^^  William Kingdon Clifford: "'It is wrong, always, everywhere and for any one, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence.'"
[@ ^ 8.] ^^ Is there 'cryptocurrency elo rating'? (aka. 'elo rating pertaining to cryptocurrency')
[@ ^ 8.1.] ^^ Blockchain & Crypto Technology books are probably '>' (bigger) in that domain-or-realm, than 'airdrop farming' ... (considering that plain 'indie-crypto lifetime narrative' is 'overwhelm' ...) 
[@ ^ 8.1.1.] ^^ In a sense that 'dry studying' of that technology somehow helps more than just plain farming/sybilling (although counter-intuitive (wtf does studying even help?!?!? (?)))) ...
[@ ^ 8.2.] ^^ Reading a substantial chunk of crypto-technology-or-blockchain-technology [<script name='book'>makeQuizElem2('Ym9vaw==','&lt;pomflh&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] before doing any faucets and/or airdrops? (?) (in a sense of 'which is higher elo level?' - wise)) -- you have staking already ... so ... 
[@ ^ 8.2.1.] ^^ What I'm trying to get to - is to do only minimalist super-obvious airdrop farming ... and like 2-3 precalculated steps (didn't need to jerky-signup for neither ampleforth, nor optimism, nor stargaze, nor evmos, nor aptos, nor paraswap, nor cowswap, etc.) ... jerky-signups definitely f*cks me up. And a 'book' before faucets could get me into an appropriate mood before jumping onto twitter? (?)
[@ ^ 9.] [WOMEN\_1] ^^ Is there such a thing as a 'dating elo rating' (as in r/datingoverfifty)? Or lack-of-dating-thereof elo-rating? In a sense that, m, it could be probably related to why ''indie-crypto lifetime narrative' elo rating' is an overwhelm, compared to 'cryptocurrency elo rating' ... ? (?) (?) (?)
[@ ^ 9.1.] ^^ Maybe it's just 'living around women' elo (without involving any sort of 'dating' or 'datingoverfifty' or 'lack-of-dating',, yet ...)
[@ ^ 9.2.] ^^ The horrid reality that ~ 30% of people don't know -- is that residental buildings (everywhere?) are dominated by women ... and by reading MRA materials you achieve two things: (1) To gather context and see also the ugly side of women unlike your reproductory organ wants to 'idealise',, and (2) Hopefully understanding of an importance of why tho f*** you should leave residential buildings from time to time (they are not really 'safety heaven') -- one of this techniques, by the way which you learned from Owen Cook about that dirty unstiffling sh*t that women do all the time. That context you got from mra/redpill. Was it helpful or harmful instead? ==> G-d knows. ... but in a sense ... it somewhat resembles the 'seeing through the matrix' analogy-or-metaphor (in a very dark and unhealthy sense, though). So jury is out on that one ... but anyway - the knocks are persistent, and are definitely an annoyance at times (bpd/did women? (?))
[@ ^ 9.2.1.] ^^ Point being: mra/redpill does help with some survival tricks where no one will explain. But only whisper. It got you f*cked, for sure, but then it also got -- internet is a double-edged sword ... point being is that ... sometimes in super-stuck states when I feel that I am what-ifs-cornered and crawling on ceilings for hours -- watching that context -- provides relief and nothing else is known to me which provides relief in those particular what-ifs-cornered-type-of-situations. Maybe I'll find it someday - but for now it's that.
[@ ^ 9.2.1.1.] ^^ To be able to find/spot/act-upon 'weaknesses' in seemningly flawless americanized female lawyers / female judges ... (for the aim of 'legal-self-defense') (is such thing even ever possible?) (?)
[@ ^ 9.2.1.1.1.] ^^ Get to books don't just stop at documentaries (that is a generic higher elo from experience in other parallel domains)
[@ ^ 10.] ^^ Is there ''indie-crypto lifetime narrative' elo rating' (aka. 'elo rating' pertaining to 'indie-crypto narrative') 
[@ ^ 10.1.] ^^ That is seemingly unfortunately is 'overwhelm' of some 'unknown kind' (when you had 8-9k$ - this was not an overwhelm) so unfortunately go back to 'cryptocurency elo rating' and dwell there? (?)

[#] Misc Notes - IFS ELO elaborations (if there's ever such thing like 'ifs-interrelated elo-rating')

[>] [OUTSIDE\_1] [FREE_TO_YELL_ZONE_1] The 'free-to-yell' zone/place (after 6PM or sometimes even before) - aspect
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Even if I'm doing tai-chi at home -- supposedly want to get outside in the evening - and try to perform it outside for the second time ... because the demonic emotions sometimes are still stuck and want to be 'yelled out' when I can 'safely' 'yell them out' (there are not many such places in gush dan, unfortunately -- and are getting less and less so).

[>] [CHESS_1] The 'Chess' aspect ... ==> Q. Wtf is chess important not to omit when dealing with 'not giving up entirely on martial arts'?
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ With e.g. bjj -- you're still suspectible to 'cult mind control'.
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ Competition, and/or 'sensing boundaries' with other 'competitive men' almost throws 'dementia' 'out of the window' (but this doesn't come for 'free' -- it's with enormously demonic emotions though).

Additional factors:

[>] The 'this guy is too old and he's trying' shame ('haha!') factor ... ==> Probably for me the coercive abuse or whatever that is - just doesn't stop with age -- just shtaktel ya shmaktel. ==> So kind of redirect it into 'ahh, I want 150 million $ bitcoin (the form of money that is not dependent on some specific person giving it to me) -- not shameful at any age'

[#] Misc Notes - Shore Border, prison and freedom narrative 

[>] Basically, the idea of visiting ramat aviv every 72 hours, is because (1) If I delay it for 'too long' then traveling there - even after 48+ hours of staying there nearby (or near) (or adjacent to) the seashore -- I still won't be able to find a difference between prison and freedom (*1) ... and will fall asleep uncontrollably (*2) ... and then I will be forcefully taken! (which is unwanted? (?) (<-- haha! lol! ... --> see (*3),(*4) --> lol! lololololololololol!) 
[@ ^ 1.] (*1) ^^ (similar things happened where I couldn't, bluntly in-your-face watching the sea and standing literally near it at night, snap out of, the thought that 'prison is better than freedom' into 'freedom is better then prison') ==> ... so how come this then couldn't come to 'being unable to dissect even after just f*cking 48+ hours staying there' (if I delayed 'myself' in petah-tikva for 'too long'?)) ???
[@ ^ 2.] (*2) (like also happened in yaar bon (I just said f*ck it - I'm laying down wtf ja! ja! - aaand so I did ... and woke up at ~ 7 pm (luckily no one noticed a near-homeless person lying on the ground ...))
[@ ^ 3.] (*3) (and then though, it might require some bueracracy to get out they might 'test' me there for half a year ... one thing is when I myself get 'напасти' and going and trying to snap out ... the other thing entirely is when other people are directly involved and are 'supervising' my 'snapping out' process,) ... (tbd1,,)
[@ ^ 4.] (*4) also I just 'vaguely' remember that no matter what you think _now_ under mild tobacco influence & possibly some other lsd-like toxins that they 'secretly' 'shoved' there,, but after you resided in the same room with 4 foreign people the 'serial humiliation' dynamic (like in handesaim with 'roi') slowly started to 'sneak in' and you wanted out of there like 'off the hot stove' ... so again ... it might be possible that some lsd-like substances in Pall Mall Blue are doing that to me (this 'unable to discern between 'prison' and 'freedom' states) ...

То есть есть такой ньюанс что ездить в Яша Хефец квартиру регулярно ... и 'дышать там 10 раз' и это типа 'может помочь' 'разбить лед' 'переезда' и/или 'frontal collision with sanitars' ... может ли? Стоит ли? Ведь потом приходится с собой зверско воевать в петах-тикве дома, после такого 'громадного' 'перепада температур' ...
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ A1.1.: Стоит, или непонятно зачем ты туда ездиешь вообще когда у тебя наконец-то есть каморка в рамат авиве (кто бы там с тобой не жил) (кроме миши? кроме мамы? ==> tbd1,,)
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ А1.1.: Пока что приходит в голову ответ такой: он 'срывается' или 'газлайтит' ... и просто 'замерять' уровень 'послевкусия' если скажем 80% послевкусие то даже дотрагиваться до двери там это 'страшно' потому что он выйдет опять 'забудет' и 'поздоровается' и потом прийдется в 'дополнительный раз' 'объяснять ему по телефону' что мол 'не трогай меня на улице, п*донак!' ... а если послевкусие типа низкое ... --- и так может 'прорываться' х/з ? (?)

[>] Q. After we passed 'ramat-gan bney-brak' boundary ... now there's problem -- if you want to go even further and 'see 'visual horison'' to 'cement' even further the 'check' of 'prison-vs-freedom' narrative (or a 'do I enjoy rape in prison beyond ramat-gan bney-brak boundary?' narrative) .... -- and the problem is: If I'm going straight to shore -- I might miss 'lamed' and sometimes there's a perplexity in regard to that during the trip -- that I yes want to 'include lamed' into my trip ... (this is a 'fleeting thought' that appears during trip), but since I must plan all ahead and I don't want 'surprises' -- then how, do I then, plan it properly, ahead of the road? (or something like that)?
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ A1.1: One answer to that would be, that, as I've said in 'father and chatgpt' section -- I am unable to be a 'programmer' nor 'ifs therapist' in petah tikva, for most likely next 30-40 years ... so that means that I do want to 'migrate my residence' to 'shore border proximity' zone ('immigration to ramat aviv was a matter of pure, sheer luck') ... and then from there on ... really either 'measure the 'aftertaste of contact with family' and move either to just touch the door (because he might 'forget' and 'greet' me on the street and even just touching the door is a f*cking invisible but a risk) ... or go deeper and take 10 breaths in the appartment itself (if aftertaste of previous contact with family is rather at a tolerable level) ... (again maybe I could write dtao: aftertaste of contact with family intensity, %).

[>] Q. Perpexity in regard to 'shore border' during the road there: Значит сказали так -- что доезжаем до границы рамат-гана бней-брака потому что чтобы проверить соседей (*1) ... а потом насчет shore border -- почему мы тогда едем в, м, через ламед а не через просто не доезжаем до 'shore border' рядом с 'хангаром' и реки 'айяркон'? 
[@ ^ 1.] (*1) ^^ См. предыдущий вопрос/ответ.
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ A1.1: И значит дальше после границы рамат-ган бней-брак мы теряемся по нескольким причинам: tbd1,,

[@ ^ 1.] (*1) ^^ Чтобы проверить что если вдруг абурптно пропадает желание чтобы меня изнасиловали в тюрьме ... на границе физической между рамат-ганом и бней-браком ... то тогда значит что это не соседи (а что-то 'превыше' стуков соседей -- какой-то другой тип 'доминации' который неизвестен мне! (потому что как так может быть -- что влияние соседей вдруг распостраняется конкретно до границы между рамат-ганом и бней браком -- и тут вдруг оно 'резко прекращается'??? -- как такое может быть если это просто одни конкретные стукающие соседи проверяющие свой 'stiffledness'??? A?))))

[##] Problems with visiting 'jascha heifetz' appartment when traveling into 'shore border proximity zone' without pre-planning ...

[>] То есть один раз Я поехал выехал вечером - и посереди дороги Я сказал - типа да! Только так ты можешь 'пробить' рамат авив ... только заезжая в ту квартиру ты можешь 'разбить' этот 'лед' 'невозможности переезда' 'по-кусочку' 'по-кусочку' ...
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ И значит проблеммы связанные с этим (с тем что ты выедешь из петах-тиквы без-плана -- но однако посреди дороги 'решишь' таки все-таки заехать туда в квартиру и 'посидеть' там 10 секунд) они такие:
[@ ^ 1.1.] Sometimes when I travel back home after doing this, I have to resort to 'gaslighting' an 'inner critic' who starts to being so annyoing that I have to start gaslighiting him: 'yes I have done the right thing by having told him about chess!' ...
[@ ^ 1.2.] I will get a 'knock' there whilst sitting in that room, and then when coming back to 'petah tikva' the next day or few days I will masturbate (and I'm just unable to sustain 'too many' both 'smoking' and 'masturbations' in petah-tikva, when I'm already in a 'did-like' state.
[@ ^ 1.2.1.] ^^ It looks like, when 'fatma' or 'julia' knocks in 'jascha heifetz' ... then the masturbating/not-masturbating afterwards, in petah-tikva -- is waaaaaaay 'beyond my control' ... and If I plan on going there every day like that -- expect a lot of 'masterbating' ... in regard to what's the least bad option ... G-d knows ...
[@ ^ 1.2.1.1.] ^^ If you were born into 'appartment buildings' then you'll die and rot in appartment buildings ... and fatmas dominate & control the appartment buildings ... give-or-take ... so who's stronger? males or females? huh?

[>] Q. Let's say that all day long (or for few days in a row) you were tirelessly ruminating on maintaing 'prison vs. freedom' elo rating ... and then by some miracle you ended up on some bycicle in, say, ramat-gan, and suddenly felt that you could 'discern' between 'prison and freedom' (as if it was a 'second nature to you') ... should you then turn back and go back home? ==>
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ A1: From one past date (a few months or a few years ago) when you were on the seashore -- looked at horison, and still could not discern between prison and freedom (as if it was your 'second nature') ... -- so theoretically it could be possible that one day, whilst looking at the seashore for 5 days in a row without leaving the seashore - you wouldn't be able even after 5 days to discern between 'prison' and 'freedom' ... so just as a matter of precaution ... maybe you'd want, if some battery is left - to travel all the way to the seashore as if it was some sort of 'hunger' that needed to be 'satisfied' ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ A1.1.: From some other past date (a few months or a few years ago) -- you were in some park and you laid on the ground, and you fell asleep (ah, just like that) and when you woke up -- it was nearly morning and you were lucky that nobody was still around (walking his/her dog or whatever etc etc etc.) ... so theoretically you could fall asleep and wake up either vandalised or in some police station.

[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ A 'photogenic-madman' is a half-joke half-irony here because to non-luckies, and non-photogenics -- photogenic people do seem a 'madmen' ... because they can easily identify with freely-downloadable hollywood/bollywood flicks and that's a huge power (and there's even 'beauty sells' proverb to back it).

[#] Misc Notes - Situational Portals for re-entry ...

[##] Preamble: 
[>] Every f*cking single day they do this to me - this sc*m sh*t neighbors ...

[>] CPTSD Book: "If I am a bit repetitive at times about issues like 'shrinking the critic' and 'grieving the losses of childhood', it is my attempt to find different ways to emphasize the great importance of engaging these themes of recovery work over and over again. If you find yourself lost and not sure of how to get back onto the map, these themes will always be key portals for reentry."

Not resting day (cryptocurrency transactions are allowed):

[>] Trying to get back to making Gmx.io/gains.trade 'practice mode' fork via re-reading that book 3 times 
[^ @ 1.] ^^ Even without coding anything - this reduces 'steepness' ...

[>] [PAPER_DECLOGGING_1] It's either 'paper clog' unclogging -- or -- this document ...
[@ ^ 1.] ^ E.g. ever-accumulating 'paper clog' might prevent you from touching computer (including 'this document'). Imagine disaster scenario in which you want to break the computer hence unable to touch it ... yet the paper clog has meanwhile accumulated for years to come ...
[@ ^ 2.] Old, toremove: 'Tremble' for 'paper clog' (paper is needed because sometimes computer is overwhelming, or broken)
[@ ^ 3.] There are 3 things with paper (1) Throwing old 'todisp_1' paper, (2) Venting traumas to the river, (3) Digitizing checkmark notes (the most difficult part). 

[>] [PAPER_BUT_WITHOUT_DECLOGGING_1] Longhand paper sometimes serves as 'portal of entry' (regardless of whether paper is being 'declogged' or 'spied on' (aka for example when I'm in 'super distress' states)) and sometimes I simply ask myself to write 'print 5+5' on paper which seems, hmm, rather odd ...
[>>> 1.] So basically you're writing on paper your thoughts, and then there's a voice: 'write 'print 5+5'' ... so what do I do then? And does it really matter?
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ Again, in a sense, it looks like the right direction here is to get tho fock out of the house due to 'r/MenGetRapedToo' dynamic that is definitely manifesting here ...
[>>> 1.1.1.1.] ^^ But let's say that you can't get outside due to some unforseen circumstance (something in the house needs to be fixed urgently or you're waiting urgently for someone, or there's some unforseen other circumstance e.g. you were in distress ... so you started writing your thougths on paper ... then a thought 'write me 'print 5+5' came', but when now you think about getting out -- the distress aren't 'gone' ... you're still in 'write thoughts on paper mode' and 'stuckness' whom you're trying to write onto paper - says: nope, not getting out!' ... -- so what do you do then? (In a sense of a 'print 5+5' thought?)
[>>> 1.1.1.1.] ^^ Because such situations did occur more than once to me.
[>>> 1.1.1.1.1.] ^^ So how do I 'continue' on that 'print 5+5' narrative? Let's say after few 'print 5+5''s in python repl prompt, you would next would want to probably write homebrew/weekend projects 'whatever you feel like' because 'disruptive technologies' and 'people are slowly 'catching up'' (aka. 'I'm having a fridge but everyone else have to go to the store and buy ice cubes' analogy)
[>>> 1.1.1.1.1.1.] ^^ So there's 'Misc Notes - What comes after 'print 5+5' section that follows on that 'disruptive technologies' 'people are slowly catching up' narrative (in a sense that if you don't do this, then ?)
[>>> 1.1.1.1.1.1.1.] ^^ Since you consider 'longhand paper' as a 'last-resort' 'portal of entry' into this document, and sometimes, a voice in your head ask you to write 'print 5+5' statement on that very same paper, which makes you 'stumble in confusion' and unable to 'continue' / to 'flow' / to 'move forward' with that particular 'portal of entry' ==> Henceforth 'meddling' with 'disruptive technologies && people are slowly catching up' narrative is a henceforth is in itself is a yes is a separate 'portal of entry' (because otherwise you'd write 'print 5+5' on longhand paper and not know how to 'continue' and hence 'longhand paper' 'portal of entry' is 'fucked' without { 'disruptive technologies' && 'people are slowly catching up' } 'portal of entry' ...

[>] [WHATS_THE_NEXT_STEP_AFTER_5_PLUS_5_1] Ruminating on 'what's the next step' after writing 'print 5+5' in python repl a few times ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Trying to be short & concise & save on words: Paper is yes a 'portal of entry' ==> 'Print 5+5' on paper voice - brings to stumblessness (wtf nonsense writing print 5+5 on longhand paper wtf) ==> Stumbles the whole 'longhand paper' 'portal of entry' 'route' ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ Important to mention here the { 'disruptive technologies' && 'people are slowly catching up' } narrative aka sometimes I get some 'miniscule' ideas about improving writing new scripts and little apps and mods that could potentially work in that domain ...
[>>> 1.1.1.1.] ^^ In at other times -- those 'little ideas' seem 'nonsense' and 'unimportant' ... so a balance has to be striken here (?)
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ Activities that might make the curve 'less steep' are obviously:
[@ ^ 2.1.] 'reading books' (langugage nuances, framework-or-technology nuances,, ?) 
[@ ^ 2.2.] 'step-through debugging and commenting 'the hell out of' minecraft code' (or a code of a project that performs almost similar function),
[@ ^ 2.3.] 'going through starter tutorials' on relevant topic,,
[@ ^ 2.3.1.] ^^ and implementing their code and 'playing around with it' by tweaking things here and there,,
[@ ^ 2.4.] Setting up sandboxed environments because restarts sometimes are a no-go ...,,
[@ ^ 2.4.] ^ Organising online materials into printable pdf's (sometimes there is just no books but very elarborate turorial)
[@ ^ 2.4.1.] ^^ So I could calmly read it as a book (in sw you don't need the materials to be academically-backed because it's experiental/experimental studying&hacking ,, tbd1)
[@ ^ 2.4.1.1.] ^^ Also google is 'mutable' and 'websites with prescious materials sometimes disappear' which is unhealthy paranoia but those are my personal projects and I'm not debating the importance of having 'coca cola secret formula' with anyone in a sense that 'setting boundaries' && 'gavin wood leverage' rule (if it is beyond setting boundaries) 
[@ ^ 2.4.1.1.1.] ^^ and in this case, in the case of 'portals of entry' the 'boundaries' are 'keep everything offline' and shoot anyone on-sight who debates that.

[>] [PLANNING_ON_PAPER_BEFORE_APPROACHING_THE_COMPUTER_OR_PHONE_1] Planning computer activities preemptively on paper in the era of ChatGPT (as a 'portal for re-entry') ...

[#] Misc Notes - Ways To Lose Access To This Document
// [#] Misc Note - Not Losing This Document (since it requires both 100$ in BTC and also Minecraft)

First off, wtf do I even need this document for?
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ You need 'bonding leverage' for 'lipton tea' and if you have a decent 'bonding leverage', then this automatically assumes the existence of this document.

How Can I lose access to this document?
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ By losing 'internet & privacy' ...
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ Eyesight loss, loss of hand(s), huge physical crippling that makes impossible to work with a computer.
[@ ^ 3.] ^^ 'Nothing is waiting for me ahead' 'it's all a f*cking turmoil' states that cause me to 'miss out' on 'coercion'/'silkom' (rus) that is mounting against me slowly-slowly ...
[@ ^ 3.1.] ^^ I needed to do self-tai-chi & shogi to be able to 'process' this clause above ^^ ... 

[##] Section: Stages of 'losing this document' (both within this document and beyond it)

[>] Q. How can 'beyond it' happen? 
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Some sort of medical emergency that requires urgent medical attention (e.g. a fallen bleeding tooth.)

Stages of loss (in brief) (situational)
[@ ^ 1.] Memory loss (of existence this document altogether)
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^ No bitcoin no more ==> Then it just becomes some 'another' document in the filesystem ...

[@ ^ 2.] 'Ideological loss' (aka. persistent 'wtf's' or some other)
[@ ^ 2.1.] ^^ Most likely due to some sort of 'r/mengetrapedtoo' surrounding dynamic (wtf were there some distinct knocks once in 5-10 minutes, that corresponded to distressing thoughts of mine? (?)) ==> They know something that I don't hence 'r/mengetrapedtoo' dynamic of sorts.

[@ ^ 3.] 'Maintaining existing elo rating' in some area hyper-focus ability?
[@ ^ 3.1.] ^^ Most likely it is the lesser loss of them all, because there are always boundaries between men, as 3mp-apr && mp-3mp-apr has shown.
[@ ^ 3.1.1.] ^^ For now the most favorite is: { 'elo rating' && 'distress books' }

[@ ^ 4.] ^^ 'Track of time' loss ==> When you forget to discern between 'before 6PM' and 'after 6PM' activities ...

[@ ^ 4.] ^^ Actual airdrop farming loss ==> This is yes considered a loss, in a sense that, those are 'playing lottery' mostly
[@ ^ 4.1.] ^^ You might just have enough from mining to 'fill up to 100$ in bitcoin for the next 20 years' (although I need to find a way somehow to be persistent in regard to 'gaming pc' so I could at least have a mining possibility)
[@ ^ 4.1.1.] ^^ So hencefor it's a loss, as in I don't know how to really petition for gaming pc ==> So it's an exponential loss 'rabbit hole'.

[@ ^ 5.] ^^ Lifetime crypto narrative can help with 'silkom' in a sense that 'silkom' coercion might disconnect me from this document. ==> So I'm putting this here, because, it definitely doesn't belong to 'paper clog resolving' yet it came up to mind when I was 'trembling' for 'stages of loss' of this document ... (so initially I've written it into 'wtf paper' section ... but then it clearly didn't fit there ... so I'm putting it here instead ... (as a 'stage of loss'? hmmm ...)) ... 

[@ ^ 6.] ^ 'Varlakova excercise' loss ==> e.g. when it feels that the right thing to do right now is to 'focus on varlakova excercise'
[@ ^ 6.1.] ^^ Why is it a more 'loss' then 'elo rating' loss? ==> Again, not taking 'boundaries between men' into account (so hence it 'feels' like a more of a 'loss' than 'elo-rating' loss ) ...

[@ ^ 7.] ^ 'Crawling towards ifs therapist' mode ...
[@ ^ 7.1.] [PROBABLY_ABOVE_PAPER_CLOG_RESOLVING_1] ^^ This is probably above 'paper clog resolving' because there is such section is yes within this document ...
[@ ^ 7.2.] [PROBABLY_NEED_MINECRAFT_FOR_CHAT_POST_AGITATION_1] ^^ Just noting though ==> You might also probably need 'minecraft' (or 'minecraft coding' (or very least 'minecraft book' 'checking-up on' aka 'distress reading'), on top of 'longhand paper' (with a clog or without) to avoid the, umm, the 'sporaidic tongue slips into ifs zoom chats and discords' ...
[@ ^ 7.2.1.] ^^ The name for tongue slips was 'chat post agitation' (without a planned delay of one day before concieving and posting (!!))
[@ ^ 7.3.] ^^ r/MenGetRapedToo dynamic might be at large at play here ... (there was also thoughts about { 'evidence flipping' 'social proof' } -- but again ... this might be a 'subset' of some general ongoing r/MenGetRapedToo dynamic (whose nuances I don't fully understand ... (due to not being their 'homie')) ...

[@ ^ 6.] ^ Paper clog resolving ==> Probably even more loss than 'varlakova' because the 'methodology of it' is beyond the scope of this document ... (aka if I'm focusing extensively on 'paper clog' for, say 48-72 hours then I'm clearly am not focusing on this document ...

Stages of loss (non-situational (aka not due some 'situational distress' that you have to 'tremble for', to 'find')) (e.g. doesn't change from 6-8-10 AM to 6-8-10 PM):

[@ ^ 1.] Neglecting minecraft coding for many many days ...
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ My estimation that minecraft is ~ 2% complete (no android version, no encrypted signs, no Ctrl-M webgl, textures are sh*tty, no 'portals',  ... (tbd1,,))
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ Testnets are not 'consistent' so it's 100$ in BTC and also is yes minecraft (I wish I had 100k$ in btc, though).

[@ ^ 2.] Losing this document by failing to negotiate properly with parents and family ...

[@ ^ 3.] Existence & availability of gains.trade 'practice mode' -- helps with 'гулкая голова' ... (and 'гулкая голова' can make me go ballistic and temporarily (situationally) lose access to this document ...)
[@ 

[@ ^ 2.] Not visiting shore border every 72 hours could cause me lose this document? (?)
[@ ^ 2.1.] ^^ Getting out in sloppy/negligient clothing and grooming is a sort of a 'noncomformism' that is 'designed' to 'plow through' 'toxic shame' (see separate topic on that) and henceforth, like any noncomformism will be pecked at by angry cops so grounding in 'police apprehension protocol' books could be important for 'not losing this document'? (maybe I'm getting too carried away here ... (?))

[@ ^ 5.] [DISRUPT_1] ^^ 'This document is a semi-public website with a legal disclamer, heh? It helps you sometimes when traveling outside, heh? It's a disruptive technology, heh? And people are slowly catching up, heh? So it might be that slowly slowly, in the future, this website's helpfulness effect might be severely diminished, heh? (?) 
[@ ^ 5.1.] ^^ I'm just speculating here, you know ...
[@ ^ 5.1.1.] ^^ In a sense that when everyone and his mother has a semi-public website then traveling outside factor of such website would be nonexistent, heh? Like e.g. when only you have a fridge and everyone else has to hop to a store to buy ice, you feel relative comfort.
[@ ^ 5.1.1.1.] ^^ So it might be not exactly how I lose this document, like in a few years ... but might theoretically happen so that even this document will get lost in the pile of 'filesystem' and I 'just won't find ... just won't find ...'

Section: Q. What to do when glided off this document, to, say, onto 'paper clog' resolving and can't touch this document for a long time still nevertheless still?

[>] ^^ A1: Tooth doctor calmed 'a little' the 'beyond 'too much spirituality'' status of my falling tooth. He, aka a certified MD doctor, has sad that by him - it is acceptable that a tooth will fall by itself, and that he doesn't see some sort of horrific medical emergency beside giving me an antibiotic, should there be an inflammation. Aka it's not 'negligience' of immense degree (if I only had a ferrari).

[>] ^^ 'Distress books' && 'ELO rating' is still insofar your best chance to save most possible organs in the body (because it ...)
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ That's so far an opinion (though maybe possible that I will be able to visit another tooth doctor in the future) ...
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ The rationale being: 
[@ ^ 2.1.] ^^ I'm able to 'open up' about much more things with myself, due to 'immersive places' promixity ... 
[@ ^ 2.2.] ^^ Less 'beyond self-disciplining' periods ... (that possibly happen due to some sort of ongoing 'r/mengetrapedtoo' resembling dynamic in petah tikva, that 
is not even my business and never was) ...
[@ ^ 2.3.] ^^ Urgency flipping - again possibly happens due to some sort of 'r/mengetrapedtoo' resembling dynamic in 'petah tikva' ...
[@ ^ 2.4.] ^^ Much, much better chance to preserve own 'self-leadership' whilst being 'bankrupt' (because really when no-bad-parts-frame-rupture ensues and there's no money -- that's not exactly going to be 'ifs therapist' ) ...
[@ ^ 2.4.1.] ^^ e.g. the 'ifs' is not a 'cover-all-umbrella' and it has an 'abyss' within it. Without addressing that ifs-and-bankrupcy--abyss it's much more difficult to address 'rotting teeth' ...

[>] ^^ I'm not even sure that I can go to bjj with a 'dental implant' (tbd1,,)

Misc Notes (tosort):

[>] [MEN_GET_RAPED_TOO_1] 'r/MenGetRapedToo' is a very dim light in eckhart tolle gloom ...

[>] So let's say we've focused on 'Distress Books' till 6PM -- and now 6 PM Came ... (tbd1,,)

[>] [GAMES_HUMAN_COMPLEXITY_1] Chess and 'shame-induced' 'self-harm' ... значит на улице все на тебя смотрят на твой холмик на лице и говорят сразу подсознательно 'чзх?!?!?' и типа у тебя это 'отражается' как 'как ты смеешь показываться с таким уродством на улицу' и доходит до 'self-harm'a итп ..
[>>> 1.1.] А теперь ты говоришь что в конце теоретически доебавшись таким образом до тебя и захаяв и поставив тебя в угол ты им или ему можешь сказать: 'окей, ты говоришь что Я ничтожность, что Я такое х*йло -- давай тогда сыграем с тобой в такую-то такую-то игру ... и обыграть его 5 раз подряд с большой вероятностью' и это типа изменит его аттидьют из 'чзх?!?!?' в 'любопытство' ('ойй, а как это ты?!?') (и таким образом у меня спадет 'shame-induced' 'self-harm' по отношению к какому-то тому конкретному человеку ... (?)) ... и вероятно всего изменит внутреннее 'отражение' чужих взглядов (или только его конкретного взгляда? (?)) меньше в направлении 'self-harm'a ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ То есть если все смотрят с 'любопытством' это как-то 'неуютно' но не то что если все смотрят с 'чзх?!?!?!' взглядом (что доводило бы до 'селф-харм'а а не 'неуютности') ... и так не доходит до 'no bad parts frame rupture' (?)
[>>> 1.2.] [YOU_CHOOSE_WHICH_GAME_1] ^^ Прикол он однако так-же в том -- что это _ты_ выбираешь какую игру ему предложить чтобы с ним сыграть, и ты выбираешь именно ту игру в которой 'mastery' берет долгие-долгие годы (и тогда больше вероятности что ты рандомального чела на улице сможешь обыграть 5 раз подряд ...) ... чем если скажем ты возьмешь тетрис аттак, а у него природная реакция лучше и он тебя через 3 матча обосрет, и скажет -- а аа -- Я же говорил 'чзх!?!?!?' -- вот ... как собственно Я и говорил! Ты - х*йло! -- И у тебя опять до селф-харма и дойдет и опять из дома никуда высовываться не сможешь, неговоря уже об накапливающемся мусоре в квартире горами итп. 
[>>> 1.3.] ^^ So this is sort of a 'lurking' dynamic that most likely will become more apparent in the future as I age ... (as a foreign immigrant in some foreign gps location) ...
[>>> 1.4.] ^^ You could also 'mix' it with 'grimacing shibashi' to even more reduce 'shame-induced' 'self-harm' effect ... (?) (or so it feels (a gut feeling)) (?)
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ Q. Again, why choosing and studying a 'weaker' game might be a problem? 
[@ ^ 2.1.] ^^ A1: Again, because, в третий раз подряд он тебя таки сможет обыграть - и скажет -- ну вот ... Я же говорил что ты л*х. А если выберешь с максимально возможной комплексностью игру то меньше таких шансов что ты ему проиграешь за 5 игр ... (tbd1,,)

[>] [PAPER_CLOG_AND_LOSING_THIS_DOCUMENT_1] Finding way back to this document through longhand paper: *MUST DISCARD THAT PAPER* that's a big key. If you use paper to find this document -- with accumulating clog -- you'll look - and never find ... never find ... never find ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Paper is better than computer in times of extreme head nausea. Because you don't trust yourself to get to computer because you'll watch endlessly that twitter feed.
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ So I suppose one activity - is to sift repeatedly through accumulated piles of paper for 1000th time, and discard, if possible! (that's a one missing key)

[>] [LOSING_CONSCIOUSNESS_1] Trying to 'make order' in 'paper clog' activities ==> What eventually ends up happening, that I get 'lost' again (because, ha! - { paper clog } is not { 'this document' } and doesn't have neither '100$ in bitcoin' nor 'minecraft coding' attached to it) (very quick, within few hours or a day or two (again, most likely due to that r/mengetrapedtoo dynamic, that is enshrined here somehow or something ...)) -- so then the most 'rational' solution would be is to 'train through injuries' (aka. like Quinton Jackson or somebody else that I don't want to mention here ...) aka 'neglect & ignore medical emergencies' just for sakes to 'not get lost again' (until I've lost conscious aka 'ability to focus' on anything at all ... (e.g. unconsciously hospitalized without being able to control it, at all)) ...

[>] ^^ Tremble for 'paper clog' (or 'this document') ...
[@ ^ 1.] Wtf tremble for 'paper clog'? ==> Sometimes I can't access to the pc b/c I know I'll watch twitter for hours and nothing will be done and I'm lost.
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ 'Trauma Grounding' via paper is impossible if a clog gets accumulated ... ==> This is definitely an incoherence for many reasons ...
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ One reason for resolving paper clog is - because I myself wrote 'todisp_1' on each page specifically ... a neglect could grow into, m, 'shoving things under the rug' and '5000 depot shots won't help' ... so it's either 'this document' or 'paper clog' ...
[@ ^ 2.] Wtf tremble for this document? ==> See notes above 'how can I lose access to this document?'
[@ ^ 3.] Taking a wild assumption here ==> Drop them in the evening into in-house garbage can ...

[>] [TAI_CHI_IMAGES_1] ^^ Also in the evening try to organise shibashi and then tai-chi images with red arrows.

[>] Mining card repair && buying rack still is relevant - it earns me 48$/year and can make this document hold, should I transfer all my earnings of rvn/ubiq into bitcoin (no need for leverage trading and/or evmos staking whatsoever (if I manage to keep programming the minecraft around this document))
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Most likely github will stay free ... (or it's clones) ...

[#] Misc Notes - Games Complexity ... (human games complexity/depth) - a separate section (since it 'itches') ...

[##] Preamble:
[>] Q. So, why such an excitement in regard to 'complex games'?
[@ ^ 1.] Basically we've asserted earlier, that, m, there is always boundaries between men (due to an 'infected laptop') and then there is an assumption that 'being lost' (e.g. in pink) is even worse than being subservient to some male, even if it is a power-abusing/authority-abusing male ...
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ And henceforth there raises a question to how to from 'being lost' state to get as quickly as possible to 'sensing boundaries' with some male (because there are always are ones those) ... and one such a vehicle is to study a complex game and 'try it out' on 'different surrounding (and non surrounding) people' (aka. a process that happens subconsciously when studying chess) ...
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ The 'finding boundaries with other people' make sense when you're 'floating in pink' for five days and unable to find yourself an fall asleep in yaar bon park ... and get apprehended by the police and that is a form of an unexpected bad surprise, something you don't want, even though sometimes you're in 'enjoy rape in prison' states (but then r/mengetrapedtoo hopefully 'snaps you out') so yes ... getting apprehended by the police is bad, m'kay?
[@ ^ 1.1.1.1.] ^^ But on top of that - if we do agree (hopefully through r/mengetrapedtoo books & subreddits) that getting apprehended by the police after falling asleep in the bushes - is yes 'bad' ... then supposedly 'finding boudaries with men' via 'playing chess' is better than 'floating in pink for 5 days' ... hence the excitement around 'complex games' ...
[@ ^ 1.1.1.1.1.] ^^ Again, if you remember from 'stages of losing this document' section,, being in 'maintaining the same elo level with { <insert here some topic-or-theme--of-interest> } ... ' state is probably the 'least bottomless pit' state ... because the boundaries with other men always exist (we know that from 3mp-apr paper experiment) ... so it's either you 'see' them ... or you 'don't' ...

[>] ^^ To recap and elaborate:
[@ ^ 1.] Any 'regular social activity' whether it's 'going to chess teacher' or 'nadine lucas zoom group' or 'ifs therapist' -- is a 'bottomless pit' (because it introduces 'ban related destabilisation' as has happened with 'xyk' on '#rschizophrenia' as he started lashing out at me for always shutting up and accused me of logging the channel and distributing/publishing it somewhere.
[@ ^ 2.] (there are 3, tbd1) ==> Second has to do with 'stages of losing this document' and 'maintaining the same elo rating' at any one particular subject is being 'on the top' because with any particular subject of knowledge either your knowledge is 'sub-par' to the 'top expert in that area' or 'less sub-par to him' (but again now we're talking about 'human boundaries' with 'expert in some area of knowledge' -- so it's again 'human boundaries' so it's again 'elo' and anything less is in some sort of way - 'sub-par' because all the knowledge in some 'xxx area' is relative to the knowledge of a person who is a 'top expert in that area' so you must 'sense the boundaries' to go as quickly as possible towards the 'top expertise' in that area)
[@ ^ 3.] There will always be boundaries and will never cease to be (as was proven with '3mp-apr' && 'mp-3mp-apr' 'infected laptop' experiment) 
[@ ^ 4.] ^^ Anything else? ==> Yes, there's 'evidence flipping' 'socially proofed' knockos (if you avoid any social contact, even if it could mean a 'ban-related destabilization' == it still could mean that you are then attacked with 'there's too many of us and there's only one of him' attack) 
[@ ^ 5.] ^^ Anything else? (?)

[>] [GAMES_HUMAN_COMPLEXITY_1] Chess and 'shame-induced' 'self-harm' ... значит на улице все на тебя смотрят на твой холмик на лице и говорят сразу подсознательно 'чзх?!?!?' и типа у тебя это 'отражается' как 'как ты смеешь показываться с таким уродством на улицу' и доходит до 'self-harm'a итп ..
[>>> 1.1.] А теперь ты говоришь что в конце теоретически доебавшись таким образом до тебя и захаяв и поставив тебя в угол ты им или ему можешь сказать: 'окей, ты говоришь что Я ничтожность, что Я такое х*йло -- давай тогда сыграем с тобой в такую-то такую-то игру ... и обыграть его 5 раз подряд с большой вероятностью' и это типа изменит его аттидьют из 'чзх?!?!?' в 'любопытство' ('ойй, а как это ты?!?') (и таким образом у меня спадет 'shame-induced' 'self-harm' по отношению к какому-то тому конкретному человеку ... (?)) ... и вероятно всего изменит внутреннее 'отражение' чужих взглядов (или только его конкретного взгляда? (?)) меньше в направлении 'self-harm'a ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ То есть если все смотрят с 'любопытством' это как-то 'неуютно' но не то что если все смотрят с 'чзх?!?!?!' взглядом (что доводило бы до 'селф-харм'а а не 'неуютности') ... и так не доходит до 'no bad parts frame rupture' (?)
[>>> 1.2.] [YOU_CHOOSE_WHICH_GAME_1] ^^ Прикол он однако так-же в том -- что это _ты_ выбираешь какую игру ему предложить чтобы с ним сыграть, и ты выбираешь именно ту игру в которой 'mastery' берет долгие-долгие годы (и тогда больше вероятности что ты рандомального чела на улице сможешь обыграть 5 раз подряд ...) ... чем если скажем ты возьмешь тетрис аттак, а у него природная реакция лучше и он тебя через 3 матча обосрет, и скажет -- а аа -- Я же говорил 'чзх!?!?!?' -- вот ... как собственно Я и говорил! Ты - х*йло! -- И у тебя опять до селф-харма и дойдет и опять из дома никуда высовываться не сможешь, неговоря уже об накапливающемся мусоре в квартире горами итп. 
[>>> 1.3.] ^^ So this is sort of a 'lurking' dynamic that most likely will become more apparent in the future as I age ... (as a foreign immigrant in some foreign gps location) ...
[>>> 1.4.] ^^ You could also 'mix' it with 'grimacing shibashi' to even more reduce 'shame-induced' 'self-harm' effect ... (?) (or so it feels (a gut feeling)) (?)
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ Q. Again, why choosing and studying a 'weaker' game might be a problem? 
[@ ^ 2.1.] ^^ A1: Again, because, в третий раз подряд он тебя таки сможет обыграть - и скажет -- ну вот ... Я же говорил что ты л*х. А если выберешь с максимально возможной комплексностью игру то меньше таких шансов что ты ему проиграешь за 5 игр ... (tbd1,,)

[##] Preamble 2 - Lesser trollable games [tag: lesser_trollable_games_tag_1,,]:

[>] In tetris attack - speed of reaction matters.
[>] In 'brown dust' - you could buy 5-star heroes (somebody very rich could still say ...)
[>] In civ5 - there are new versions (so the factor of 'studying the game for 20 years and then consecutively get 5 wins from a person' diminishes (because now there's civ6 - 'why don't we play civ6 instead?' ==> 'I told you you're sh*t')

Other notes:
[>] Sometimes I feel like asking on the internet : can you suggest a paper similar to 'depth balancing and limits of the elo model' by 'cauwet, teydaud' et. al. ... and the answer is ... 
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Probably you don't want to do that to find out that the game of go that you've been studying for all these years is not 'complex enough' and you have to 'restart' from scratch ... and then shoot yourself in the head for 1000 times ...
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ Talking to michael about 'wtf, you were better off than me' - will just provoke the 'atudai-atudai' response ...
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ Israel is a village? ==> Israel is a village.

[#] Misc Notes - Frame With Chess Teacher ...
[#] Misc Notes - Crawling towards chess teacher ...

[##] Preamble ...

[>] But then it said ... (during road to ramat aviv) ... 'you're getting it all wrong!' ==> So it's an 'ifs critic' then that prevents me go to the chess teacher! ==> So then go to ifs therapist! ==> But with ifs therapists there's ban, but with 'texel-only' chess teacher there's seemingly no ban! ==> So 'varlakova excercise' && 'chess teacher' (?) (?) (?)

[##] Preamble 23 - Rootedness in chess (vs. Varlakova)

[>] [LESSER\_TROLLABLE\_GAME_1] Chess from the perspective of 'lesser bottomless pit' ==> When you need (maybe Brad Pitt & Matt Damon doesn't) a cult (somewhere to 'bring yourself somewhere' to ...) -- then chess suddenly starts making a huge sense (from previously being 'some stupid, idiotic game that no one plays anyway') because either you're in 'lesser bottomless pit' or 'bigger bottomless pit' -- how do you sense that? ==> One answer is to play with your _current_ cult leader a _lesser trollable_ game (in which he cannot 'trick' you with either 'sleight of hand' or 'big sum of money' (buying FEH heroes) (because what he really does is trying to 'prove' his capacity/incapacity  for the totalitarian authority (the 'wow' factor), and then make follow his commands, blindly, regardless of whether they make any sense at all whatsoever (b.c. nobody is going to sit now for hours and explain ratioinale behind every single one of his 'orders' he just simply doesn't have 'time') ...  because that's how the brain works (in the 'bring myself somewhere' mode -- it blindly follows the commands to kind of battle the 'outside world overwhelm' (because (1) You are here. (2) Blindly follow commands and f*ck everything else. (3) Then the 'outside world overwhelm' problem gets resolved.) ... but sometimes that leader gets the, m, so-called 'barry gibbs phenomenon' ('noble cause corruption') or the 'authorative power abuse' 'groove' ... and then you still follow his commands, but now, into the oblivion ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Key takeout is: 'lesser trollable game'
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ Again, being some jonestown adept might be a good thing and chess might be not needed, but the problem is that you might end up 'half-poisoned' and then you'll again might need 100k$ leverage instead of 8-9k$ leverage to be able to go & buy 'lipton tea' ...

[>] [WINNING_TEN_TIMES_IN_POKER_1] Chess from the perspective of 'human games ELO complexity' -- allows, without being superior from the aesthetic and/or physical strength or physical 'bulkiness' perspective (though with 10 years experience, but still, ...) to win 5 or even 10 times in a row over random other person who invested 2 weeks into the game (not possible with poker ten-year-experienced player) and that might help 'save face' in the 'aa ken, ken ... atudai, atudai!' sense in which you just 'back off and never ever return' due to 'shame' .... those are 'rare' circumstances but super, super painful ... so people end up investing 10 years in some stupid chess game ==> but _nobody_ (besides some anon texel-only chess teacher) has to know.

Preamble 1:

[>] The idea is to counter 'Evidence-flipping' 'socially-proofed' knockos (without much regard to 'games complexity' because probably there's even less baduk teachers in israel  ...) (aka all games that larry kaufman, who is chess GM compared ...)

[>] Also, the idea is to not talk to chess teacher about topics other than chess, just need to get from him that 'переглянуться с кем-то, и сказать - чзх?!?!?' vibe  ...

Preamble 2:
[>] Does region in which chess teacher resides, matter? I a sense of 'lesser embodiment region' vs. 'better embodiment region'?

Preamble 3 - wtf chess teacher on top of offline katrain & texel - from my own perspective (not something that I might want to share with him one way or another):

[>] 'Evidence-flipping' 'socially-proofed' knockos ... 

Preamble 3 - tbd1,,,,

[>] Q. If i don't want to discuss this with anyone, then how will I pay to chess teacher?

[>] ^^ With father, probably shouldn't talk ... 

Preamble 5 - Chess Teacher focus. vs. 'Key Portals For Reentry' focus ...

[>] Another point-of-view: A your-own-semi-useless-software you write is still super-unique in a sense that one ahk script might make you more 'unique' than what you would have been if you studied chess for 20 years ... and in that sense, maybe 'plowing through' to chess teacher as a response to 'evidence flipped' 'socially proofed' knockos might not pay off in the long term as well as 'own-semi-useless-ahk-scripts writing' although this is a defininitely a debatory/debated point.

[##] Preamble - crawling towards piano (this is yes chess loss related)

[>] This is yes chess-teacher related (soothing chess losses) and since sometimes you need to resort to 'crawling towards chess teacher' as a 'portal for reentry' ...

[>] Non-copycat discipline. So books on piano sometimes miss the point. Sometimes.

[>] Alex Ham is gone (inconsistent)

[##] Preamble - Limits problem - How many notes do I play? How much is enough?

[>] ^^ Sometimes I get here after 'dtao' ... (rarely am I capable to think like that ...)

[>] ^^ After each neighbor knock - I'm saying 'another gaslight' ... don't know how over the long term this will f*ck me up!

[>] Q. Wtf are dtao needed?
[@ ^ 1.] A1: For now, please re-read section 'Polarization: Father and Gush Agadol Polarization (or maybe more than one)'

[>] Program homebrew semi-useful apps with chatgpt to sustain insanity of it all. When want to publish something online - it has to be tangentially correlated with chess. Disruptive technologies - people (incl. him) are slowly catching up. This could in short-term reduce fainting. Over the long term - I don't know. If you have 'nothing to program' then start with '5+5 excercise' and improve your sw-kata (with chatgpt).

[##] Preamble - Assume I was super-human -- I feel the hint of daily-warmup routine ... -- what is it?

[###] Assuming I was super-human - What comes before - palpating 

[>] Q. What comes before { { making my own chess engine with chatgpt } && { memorising protector questions with chatgpt } && { Shibashi, Move-Only-Tai-Chi and all related work } } ? ==> 'Distress books' && publishing on the internet only what's tangentially correlated with chess/go/shogi/xiangqi (due to f*cking 'ChatGPT' advent overwhelm that destroyed my distress-books-grounding routine, again.)

[>] Q. What comes before 'airdrops time tracking'? ==> Firstly, (1) Making own chess/go engine with help of chatgpt and secondly, (2) memorising protector questions for overwhelms, with help of chatgpt and thirdly - (3) Shibashi (and all related work (incl. offline building pictures sequence of shibashi sequence)) and then Non-Martial Copy-cat Tai-Chi (as if it were without martial moves (as a natural 108 progression of 20 shibashi)).
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Probably the 'martial aspect of tai-chi' should somehow come through memorising ifs-protector-questions (aka. it's f*cking trauma of a kind) ...

[>] Q. What comes before 'crypto-security--pomodoro-time-tracking--organisation' ==>  Getting to a place where I 'track' my 'airdrops' and 'testnets' via. 'pomodoro technique' ...

[####] Q. What comes before { One-cent-a-year vs. Zero-cents-a-year } narrative - pomodoro time tracking? (the more 'immediately obvious' steps)

[>] ^^ 'Airdrops & testnets' 'pomodoro-style' time-tracking ...

[>] Q. What comes after 'airdrops time tracking' and 'making-own-chess-engine-with-chatgpt && memorising-protector-questions-with-chatgpt && shibashi-pictures-organizing'? ==> 'Crypto Security' 'pomodoro time tracking' organisaton (either on paper or in some file (but it must be a written text, in this case 'pomodoro time tracking' of crypto-security topics will rarely work in-the-head))

----
[>] Q. What comes after sw kata? ==> One-cent-a-year vs. Zero-cents-a-year narrative - pomodoro time tracking

[>] Q. What comes after One-cent-a-year vs. Zero-cents-a-year narrative - pomodoro time tracking? ==> Write a sentence on longhand paper about relation to yourself. Ты мне дорог / Я принимаю итп. (There's a benefits to writing things on longhand paper. Just Ask ChatGPT. He agrees ...)

[>] Q. What comes after writing sentences on longhand paper? ==> Disposing of paper and trauma work ... 

[>] Q. What comes 'disposing of paper' and 'trauma work'? ==> 'Trembling' for 'Varlakova' excercise 

[##] Preamble - What are some necessary pomodoro-time-tracking chunks that I need to address at least once-a-few-days (without order)

[###] Grounders that are before pomodoro, when we're not even start talking about pomodoro - level 0 (something's 'broken' in my mind) ...

[>] 'Losing this document' (inability to get back to 'focusing' on this document)

[###] Grounders that are before pomodoro, level 6 (logistics) (something broken not in my mind, but in logistics, mind-blog interface, laptop, peripherals, food, money (cash), hardware/software/bitcoin/minecraft, bycicle etc.)

[>] ^^ Minecraft got erased / Bitcoin plummeted to 0$ and solana/phantom was hacked, an unable to get to 100$ in bitcoin / computer burned & malfunctioned / bycicle malfunctioned / tbd1 ... 
[@ ^ 1.] Elaborating (what else could go wrong in human-myblog112 interface):
[@ ^ 1.1.] Computer or a mining card malfunctioned.
[@ ^ 1.2.] Father casually decided to gaslight me so, that I won't have any more money (after all, I'm dancing on his pole).
[@ ^ 1.3.] [SEVERE_MALNUTRITION_1] ^^ Severe malnutrition: no schnitzel, banana, tea, etc ... - no pomodoro will most likely not work here (esp. with addition of pertenient 'aggressive gaslighting') ...
[@ ^ 1.4.] Money-to-receipts exchange clog (aviator? (?))

[###] Grounders that are before pomodoro, level 10 (when we can yes focus on this document, but still unable to focus on any 'pomodoro specifically' ) 

[>] ^^ 'Making a chess engine of my own with help of chatGPT' -- no 'pomodoro' applies here somehow yet this is super-important grounding activity.

[>] ^^ Memorising ifs protector questions for overwhelms with help of chatgpt -- no 'pomodoro' applies here somehow (this 'ideally' should be 'done' in my mind as a 'super-human' haha) ...

[>] ^^ Shibashi-in-pictures (and other moving meditations beyond shibashi).
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Tai-chi needs free-to-yell zone, yet getting outside and plowing-through multi-cultural eye-contact-innuendos in-tha-elevator-and-beyond might require some additional rooting-in-books (to not get to "f*ck you, you darned inner critics, tired of y'all" states) ...

[###] Pomodoro themes (tbd1,,) ...

[>] ^^ Security & Privacy: Computer security - as much as possible (a 'grounder' amidst crazy, overwhelming voices)

[>] ^^ Emergency tooth cleaning - 4 x 5 mins.

[>] ^^ Dtao obfuscation sw (dtao in 'public website' or in 'paper that is open for all to see' - is 'burnout' ... will be 'witchhunted' ...) - 2 x 5 mins (or more)

[>] ^^ Minecraft pomodoro tracking, besides 'airdrop pomodoro tracking' (as, due to do-kwon-crash, this document requires both '100$ in bitcoin' and 'minecraft' (?))

[##] Misc Notes (of 'least bad trajectories' section) 

[>] Theoretically speaking, there are always 'subtle' (or 'not-so-subtle') boundaries between males ... and ... with 'ifs', under all 'books' and 'vast trees of theory' - they are 'still to be found' ... which is not to my advantage because when I 'find' those boundaries, I will be probably 'subservient' which might be 'ok' (richard schwartz also needed other therapists at some points) but not 'ideal' (especially if you're locked-in with him for a longer term). (why did I write this? (?)) ...

Preamble 1 - Why I think I should even care:

[>] What MRA/LWMA/MenGetRapedToo taught me? (tbd1,,

Preamble 2 - Why I think sometimes that could be held responsible for that parents' (or whoevers) fuckup?

[>] What 'Tyler Durden' && 'Eckhart Tolle' && 'Hanan Sagiv' && 'Mehmet-oz' did ...
[@ ^ 1.] Tyler made me ashamed of my 'ego projection' (it is 'evil')
[@ ^ 1.] Eckhart & Other NLP practitioners have taught me 'spiritual bypass' (aka. 'just dissociate' && 'f*ck it') 

[>] What 'James Duane' && 'Innocence Project' group taught me
[@ ^ 1.] tbd1,,

Preamble 3 - Why after all I know, I think I still should be afraid of 'confrontation' and 'escalation' with parents and psychiatry?

[>] I still smoke cigarettes and I might not be able to climb back onto favoxil, before parents escalate (and with smoking, under hospitalisation & forced-in-your-throat pills) - this might be very risky, to say it mildly ...

Preamble 5 - What I wish I had (what would help me but alas is gone)

[>] [GAINS_TRADE_1] So far, I can't 100% rely on 'gains.trade' (for negotiation 'wtf I have this trump card' leverage) practice mode because they can shut it off at any time. So it's important to do some steps to replicate gains.trade practice mode ('at least I tried ...') ...

[>] [BONDING_LEVERAGE_FOR_NEGOTIATION_1] So far, I can't rely on 8-9k$ for negotiation 'wtf I have this trump card' leverage - because those are non-methodological and not systematic.

Preamble 8  - Preceeding Context Try 1:
[>] Ну давай скажем что типа благодаря '~ 100$ in bitcoin' и также gains.trade' practice-mode-'у ... типа и также скажем пониманию что у аурелия брауэрс это типа 'смотрение слишком долго в 'бездну'' которая может привести к 'unexpected bad suprise' of such a degree that it would be beneficial to just live and die natural death somewhere in the future would be 'less catastrophic' than such 'unexpected bad suprise' ... we want to navigate ourselves back to 'near-lamed' and/or find some other 'semi-shady-acceptable' solution to the impending clash with 'conservator'/'опекун'/'апотроптос' ...

[>] Далее Я хочу квеллить/'to quell' his doubts that I'm 'lazy' (his 'fingerprint'/'cornerstone' 'gaslight') and not doing anything, via, sending him relevant book summaries (that I'm reading and are relevant to programming) ... 
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ But then again, this spirals me into infinite dilemmas about what am I to send him (thanks, knockorz, who probably got infinite amount of monero, so that they could 'back up' their 'stifledness' checks every 5 minutes (in a 'who's the most unstiffled person in the building' competition dynamic)) and eventually effectively makes me _unable_ to send him sh*t which in turn 'strengthengs' his 'claim' that I'm a 'lazy'/'worthless' bum (his 'fingerprint'/'cornerstone' gaslight) ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ So what am I to do what am I to do what am I to do?!?!?

Overview (of line of defense):

[>] His gaslighting 'накаленный разговор' (cannot find, will have to 'improvise', by 'making it all about high-tech job'):
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Want to find from that phone call how did I call it 'заостренная зона?' ?

[>] Safety nets for his gaslights & backing up on promises (again, do not debate gaslighting with him, but to be able to guide myself from post-conversational glooms & twilights):
[@ ^ 1.] [SAFETY_NET] Posting him books summaries (of difference between '12 year-old smart contract developer' and '30 years old smart contract developer')

Tasks: (they are here):

[>] HDD Password on desktop pc - not done.

[>] ^^ So far, I can rely probably the best, on coding my own semi-useful projects (and minecraft) that might be semi-useful to me in the future (for myself) as my best chance of 'negotiation leverage' ...
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ How is that even a 'negotiation leverage'? (?)
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ A1: For example, this document is a semi-public website with a legal disclamer, heh? It helps you sometimes when traveling outside, heh? It's a disruptive technology, heh? And people are slowly catching up, heh? So it might be that slowly slowly, in the future, this website's helpfulness effect might be severely diminished, heh? (?) 
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ I'm just speculating here, you know ...
[@ ^ 1.1.1.1.] ^^ In a sense that when everyone and his mother has a semi-public website then 'traveling outside factor' of such website would be nonexistent, heh? Like e.g. when only you have a fridge and everyone else has to hop to a store to buy ice, you feel relative comfort.

[#] Misc Notes - Emergency -- Tooth fully broken.

Tooth and 'gloom'/'twilight zone' (in regard to whatever to do next with a tooth):
[>] Врач вроде меня в отделение скорой помощи - не послал. Он сказал что может быть воспаление - и лицо может набухнуть и дал антибиотик на такой случай. 
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Но он так-же сказал, что, мол, м, мля -- останешься без зуба ... то есть по его версии/мнению - такие вещи бывают, и они типа с его точки зрения - приемлемы.
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ С моей стороны - мы хотим 'пережить' это 'медленное распадание' зуба - контроллировать на какой стороне лица мы не можем -- то что мы можем сделать - это чистить и полоскать зуб/рот один раз в день как мы с коронавирусом мыли руки. И покупали всегда мыло. Почистил/прополоснул когда встал -- подождал 5 минут -- продолжил свои дела. Ты после того как моешь руки - каждый раз не вкуриваешь ... но в любом случае ... просто хотим пережить распад зуба и чтобы не накапливалась там инфекция до того как щека разбухнет и прийдется там серьезно оперировать. Как и руки которые ты всегда моешь с коронавирусом. Просто не пропускать. 
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ Почистить 2 раза потому что основное кол-во пасты уходит на сломанный зуб -- во второй раз - акцентироваться на правой половине рта.
[@ ^ 1.1.1.1.] ^^ Второй раз - оставь на вечер ... вспомнишь или нет ... потому что у тебя проблеммы с памятью -- а пока - пусть остальные зубы гниют. Ты меня слышал.

Подведение моей (эмердженси ситуации к квалификациям искомого доктора):
[>] То есть когда есть микре херум -- то просто нужно чтобы доктор был с университетским образованием и чтобы был с какой-то теудой.

[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Apparently, reading 'chess book' as a means of 'не краснеть перед учителем' после каждого урока - is then yes of importance, probably more of importance than a baduk/shogi/xiagqi book because it's that that chess teachers are prevalent in israel, and not go/baduk/shogi/xiangqi ones (simply because chess is the most popular of them all, and you're going to chess teacher not to play chess, but to verify 'переглянуться с кем-то и сказать 'чзx?!?!?'' amidst possibly 'evidence flipping' 'social proofed' certain types of neighbors, because even bjj doesn't work when the whole mob 'intentionaly' thinks differently).
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ I think the reason why 'chess teacher' does help with evidence-flipping social-proof yet regular bjj does not, is because in bjj there's also that dynamic of 'if lost to everyone and couldn't do a single mount/sweep' -- then you'll think that 'bjj is too much for you' etc and with chess teacher, if you lose to texel, pretty much nothing happens.

[#] Ifs Therapists Landscape Ban Discernance ('Ifs therapists incoherence') and what we are doing next

[>] ^^ Preamble: If you can't 'discern' between prison and freedom (for the sake of self-reprimanding via 'you'll lose 100$ in bicoin then you'll lose access to this document') then so far you can at least discern the 'ifs therapists landscape ban' vs. 'sleep doctor final verdict' 'in-between-chairs' situation as an 'undesireable' situation ... (even though 'rape in prison is yes 'enjoyable'' -- the {'ifs therapists landscape ban' vs. 'sleep doctor final verdict' in-between-chairs } is at least for now, still yet, just yet, is still yet - undesireable (in a sense of 'not enjoyable')
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ And the 'bigger' problem with it ... is that if I felt the difference between 'prison' and 'freedom' -- I could 'discipline' myself e.g. via 'if you leverage trade -- you'll go to prison!' but @#$% I can't even self-discipline myself here for that! (!!!) Damn! Damn! Damn! Damn! Damn!
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ So we're left with, like, m, 'tremble for that incoherence' (and hope and pray that we don't start liking the 'being between chairs' between { banned from all ifs therapist and 'sleep doctor final verdict' isn't 'in' yet } too ... just as we love already the 'rape in prison' thing ... ) (?)

[>] [2022.11.11 23:59] ^^ Update: apparently even the, m, hyper-focus on 'ifs therapists landscape ban' incoherence - кануло в канун (или в 'pink' х/з) --> I just stopped feeling even that 'boundary' !!! (!!!)
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Do not panic, probably it's because it doesn't address 'tai-chi'? ==> So then back to 'maintaining elo rating' of 'discernance' between 'prison' and 'freedom' ... (?)
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ Or back to 'ifs therapists' 'crawling mode' because I don't feel any boundary now whatsoever!!
[>>> 1.1.1.1.] ^^ Bye bye, 'books fasting' ... (?)

[>] [DRAFT_1] ^^ So then what are we doing next, according to that discernance?

[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Though again it has that 'looking too long into abyss' element so still you want to travel to n.q. from time to time to obtain that 'lesser-looking-into-abyss' 'prison-vs-freedom' discernance ...

Things to do:

[>] 'Books fasting' under 'leverage-trading-cheerleading' knockors ... 
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Since we're talking here about issues 'like' 'death' and 'suicide' -- maybe even listening to alex ham is a burnout (doesn't fit 'death' narrative) ... 
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ There were people not long ago who lived on books only. Didn't know about guitars. My head is over-buzzing from whole-day-twitter viewing. 
[>>> 1.1.1.1.] ^^ So refer back to 'distress_books_1' section even after 6PM.

[>] 'Distress coding' (besides 'distress book') to 'keep'/'hold onto' this document (upto minecraft-in-webgl-on-ctrl-m) because 'death' is a 'tearing thing' surely it will tear this document apart - one way or another (either through clicking 'trade' button or some other 'unexpected bad surprise' scenario) ... ==> There's also 'distress coding to save this document' section ...

[>] 'r/MenGetRapedToo' is also very much related to 'sleep doctor final verdict' incoherence but I guess I have some 'exposure' to it through 'distress books' (in which 'mra/women/mengetraped' books also are included (see that 'distress_books_1' section (but last time I checked -- they are yes included there ...) ...) ...

[>] Coding father excercise - потому что ты понимаешь что они 'сильнее' потому что у них 'у миши', 'у папы' ... жизнь 'удалась' и по этой причине они 'сильнее' и писать программки чтобы сжалились над тобой/надо мной что мол когда разговор зайдет 'в тупик' опять -- каким то макаром выражать это через 'программу' но до 'силком' не довести (в худшем случае 'пересказывать' книгу своими словами) ...

Old-torevise-or-remove:
[>] Code minecraft in ecma script on Ctrl-M, and all preludes before that minecraft (After 6 PM).
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ How's that even related to that discernance? (?) ==> Well call that a 'hunch' since that one is 'looking too long into the abyss' and I can't tell you straight from abyss all the answers to all the 'why's' ... but then again if something better than this comes along then we'll probably know and prioritise ... (tbd1,,)
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ So for now we're doing what? The 'search in all db's' script? (tbd1,,)
[>>> 1.1.1.1.] ^^ The section of 'minecraft_homebrew_precursors_1_tag_1' was very difficult to find, so I had to resubmit trades at gains.io,, and most likely even with having one document -- they will be spread all over the document and there will be few inconsistencies on what's the next micro-step or next micro-pilot,, so worst case - you'll do two micro-pilots at once or one micro-pilot twice ... no biggie ... (it's _our_ homebrew ... ) ...

[>] Wtf Paper? Wtf?
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ It would cause immense calmness during 'catastrophes' (which inevitably of course this planet earth is not devoid of) or during 'devastating losses' or during 'inner-critic-overwhelm' states ... if I could just put all my thoughts on paper, as a 'calming'/'spindown' technique. And henceforth the paper serves as 'grounding' 'entry portal' to try and aspire to, if I lost this very document.
[@ ^ 2.] 'Я сейчас психану' - like states ...
[@ ^ 3.] ^^ 'Nowhere to 'shove' myself' - like -- states ...
[@ ^ 3.1.] ^^ Those sometimes happen few days after sporaidically 'stumbling upon' the even the 'smell' of michael's immigrational adaptation and success ...
[@ ^ 4.] ^^ If I'm still in some sort of undecided borderline medical emergency (that I can't focus on this document properly (thoughts take me 'away' (e.g. another tooth loss))) ==> and henceforth I need to clean up the clog for exactly those types of scenarios., 
[@ ^ 5.] ^^ In some 'ultra-dense population homes' there are _hours_ without 'definite descisions' where some descision jumps in but then it's clearly not what need be done (aka. 'подвешенность state') and ability to be able to freely write or even draw on paper without worries (ok, there are masturbations, I know, ...) during those states -- is paramount (?)

[##] Smart-ass responses to the critic? (?)

[>] I am curious in regards to your 'positive intent', my dear inner critic ... could you maybe somehow marginally explain it to me? (because every part is supposed to have maybe twisted, but still a positive intent)

[>] I know that that what we've told him about chess -- it's sh*t, but let's lets look at the bright side of things, for a change ... (as opposed to how bad things are) ...
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ And try to enumerate the advantages (tbd1,,)
[@ ^ 1.1.] Advantage #1: It emphasized the ultra-importance of chess in my internal neural net (in my brain) ... earlier I've though 'hah, what is this shit crap chess anyway!?!?! wtf!?!?!' and now it's def changed so in a sense, I possibly got super-important reference experience here for 'almost free' (e.g. he has much more years kilometrage in life than I don't ) ...
[@ ^ 1.1.]

[##] Assuming you've held onto 'not letting go entirely of martial arts narrative':

[>] You had to be smarter than a mere 'chess player' to 'not talk about chess' ... so what was it? (because chess players would happily talk and teach about chess day-and-night) -- so what was it then?

[>] It wasn't out of 'recklessness' ... every time I told there was a 'deal' behind it ... first time when I told him about bridge, I needed him to stay with me in appartment in ramat aviv (b/c rent for 1 person for karni 19 street was 'too high') ...

[#] Misc Notes - You must hold onto my crypto - voice (not in db, but here?)

[##] Preamble 15 - Relation to 'bridge 3h punishment'

[>] ^^ In regard to that overwhelming crypto-crypto voice ... -- is the need for 'holding onto my crypto', as, the need for '3h bridge punishment', -- spacial? In a sense that, in petah tikva I'd need extremely bridge 3h punishment (due to { lack of prison vs. freedom discernance } combined with { the need for self-disciplining and self-accountability} ?) yet in ramat-gan--near-bney-brak I'd need 'less of' 3h bridge punishment to get by ... and in 'shikun lamed and ramat aviv' I'd need even less of 'bridge 3h punishment'? I'm saying that because, bridge 3h punishment makes me wanna teach myself to smoke, and I'm almost puking when I'm peeing (def. a serious health problems down the road ...)

[>] ^^ Sometimes the head is so preagnant ... so pink ... that merely nothing works for the overwhelming 'crypto, crypto' voice ....

[>] ^^ In a sense that 'I'm too burned out for martial arts',, 'crypto-crypto voice still keeps annoying and overwhelming' ... and I still cannot find cannot find ... cannot find ... amidst that 'situational descision overwhelm' ... somebody out there to negotiate with ... over what's the 'least bad option' ....

[>] ^^ With 'bridge 3h punishment' and 'multi-overdosing' on [already beyond-ovedosed] cigarettes ... you can find that 'situational descision' ... that one voice that will tell you what to do right now, right here ... (but then again, this is (1) ultra-poisonous. (2) supremely and extremely neurotic, most likely leading to self-headslapping later on and the onset of 'bad body signals' ...) ...

[###] ^^ What I got now in the sense that can make that '3h bridge punishment suffer' easier?

[>] A 'leverage trading' app that I made with the help of ChatGPT -- does it 'ease the suffer'? ... in a sense that when I'm in a 'all loss overwhelm' and am about to get into a 'major gambling binge' (or something) ... that trading simulation app maybe could help me come to some senses ...

[>] ^^ 100$ in bitcoin and a [hopefully working] mining card that could hopefully keep those 100$, at 100$ value. Keeps this document, on top of other document, precisely for that purpose ...

[>] Cults documentaries and books awareness (in a sense, that, without cults aka eckhart tolle trumping on stephane) there probably wouldn't be any bridge? (or something ...) -- in a way cults books help 'clean karma' by studying cults, and realising about a cult (or a family cult) that you potentially could be in, without being aware of it (or by having repressed it).

[>] Experience with Nadine Lucas Group - better than bridge in some senses ... because it being 'therapeutic' for one (at least you could ask, whilst in psych ward, to meet with nadine lucas group? (?) (though likely unrealistic)) ...

[###] ^^ What doesn't ease the suffer at all?

[>] 'Banano burn' as a form of 'self-punishment' for over-consumption of information, food, etc. -- probably it's broken now, due to SBF or whatever, ... -- so putting it into 'doesn't ease suffer' for now ... because I still don't have that 'semi-stable' 1$/day income ...

[>] ^^ Minecraft 32 bit ....


[##] Preamble 7 - 'Resilient Crypto Voice' - Losing this document ...

[>] Is 'you must hold onto my crypto' an indicator that you're about to 'lose' this document? A-la 'stages of losing this document'? And that you want to 'tremble' 'for' 'losing'/'not losing' this document? (?)

[##] Preamble 8 - Estimating crypto (aka. 150 million $ in bitcoin) via 'probabilistic thinking' ...

[>] ^^ I'm getting confused so let's downgrade it to 'one-cent-a-year' first ...

[###] Onward 2 (with one-cent-a-year narrative ...), Venues:

[### #] ^^ Okayish venues (one-cent-a-year-narrative, temporary help with overwhelm)
[>] ^^ Currently, one-cent-a-year narrative is sustained with mining only (evmos got below 0.7$, could get to 0.0001$ as far as I know).

[>] [AIRDROPS\_1] ^^ Investing my time into speculative airdrops and speculative incentivized testnets ('Ampleforth' - style) ==> 0%
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Was a matter of luck, and stemmed from me doing 1-cent-a-year micro-steps on publish0x ... now the chance of such is closer to 0%, as airdroppers cumulative hivemind gotten smarter, after uniswap ... now they are even testing sybils (as with optimism's airdrop) ... the requirements are unknown ... and also, now I have bought a mining card specifically for this purpose ...
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ It's unstoppable anyway, in a sense of me binging twitter, testnets telegram channels, and such, and inevitably being exposed to one signup or another ...
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ Also it's worth of noting that a maximum you could expect from such activities, with colossal investments of time that could be otherwise spent on stuying from chatgpt, is probably 4000$/year ... (but that's a 'wishful' and 'speculative' who knows what kind of SBF comes next and crashes all markets) ...

[>] [HIVE_BLOG_1] ^^ Journalism via hive.blog / leofinance.io ==> 0.1%
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Problem with this is that there's a problem of 'chat post agitations' when responding to comments to my 'posts' (sometimes _all_ i'm trying to do is to abstain from posting at any cost ... and with this type of activity, such things will most likely slips will most likely unnoticedly occur) ...

[>] [NFTS_1] ^^ Dall-e / crayon && selling NFT's

[>] [ARBITRAGE_BOT] ^^ Bachini's arbitrage bot for 1$/day ... (?)

[>] [FAUCET_1] Doing a faucet a few times or playing faucet-like game (?)
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Brown dust still a good fit? (?) 

[### #] ^^ Less okayish venues (either too 'grandiose' or 'too sparse' to temporarily help with overwhelm)

[>] ^^ Making my own blockhain game (too far-fetched, will cause more overwhelms than it will solve probably)

[>] ^^ Making concensus / governance chain (again, too sparse, will have a lot of 'people factor' will 'blow up' definitely not for calming down the situational crypto overwhelm).

[##] Preamble 12 - 'Resilient Crypto Voice' - Relation to Bridge 3h Punishment ...

[>] ^^ First of all, there's 'bridge 3h punishment' section within this document ... might make sense to check it from time to time, but let's try and focus here on relation of 'crypto 2+k$ existence' vs. 'bridge 3h punishment' ...

[>] ^^ 'Tremble for 'daily bridge 3h punishment' && 'chatgpt' && 'bonding leverage' (the accent is on 'chatgpt' in a sense that now that I've lost 8-9k$ Do Kwon's and also anchorprotocol.com, maybe ChatGPT could help me somehow here (I already wrote 'some sort of reminiscence of a 'leverage trading simulation' app maybe more like this one could be written, for the 'lost 8-9k$')

[##] Preamble 12 - 'Resilient Crypto Voice' - Get Back To Pomodoro Tracking (or even whole computer usage tracking on a longhand page, in petah tikva) ...

[>] It is very important, although seems 'trifle' ... to get back to 'tracking' our 'twitter binges' into some document via pomodoro.
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Sometimes, it takes 20-30 minutes of 'walking' and 'trembling' to get to the point where you can 'pomodoro track' your 'crypto-twitter binges' ...
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ Somehow, when doing this step, I got stuck also on doing the 'disruptive technologies' && 'people are slowly catching up ...' vs. ChatGPt step (aka. ask chatgpt to 'spit out' for you the, m, incremental pilots for making your own minecraft, which is needed for 'reframing' 'mental abysses' as a 'deep chasm' in minecraft)
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ On top of it all there was also my 'leverage trading simulation app' (which is of a 'category' of 'disruptive technologies' && 'people are slowly catching up' ... kind ...)
[@ ^ 1.1.1.1.] ^^ Mining card and spare fans (for both of them) (aka. a 'safe' 'one-cent-a-year-vs.-zero-cents-a-year' narrative), occupies utmost priority atop of any web2/web3 'jerky' twitter airdrops .. YOU NEED SAFETY IT IS NOW GONE ... anything else is a blatant time waster and an 'addiction binge' insofar as far as both fans are not fixed (and/or additioonal ~ 1500-1900 NIS card bought (in case of fan malfunction & overheating emergency)) ...
[@ ^ 1.1.1.1.1.] ^^ "Ожидать, что наркоман бросит употреблять свой наркотик, все равно что просить обычного человека представить себе жизнь без всех его социальных навыков, общественной поддержки, эмоциональной стабильности, а также чувства физического и психологического комфорта." O. Зыков ('В царстве голодных призраков. Лицом к лицу с зависимостями.')
[@ ^ 1.1.1.1.1.] [DRAFT_1] [I'm not sure maybe I should delete this]: ^^ That all bears striking similarity to 'minecraft' (aka. 'disruptive technologies') and 'banano burn' (aka. 'twitter binging' which is half-a-problem and half-a-solution (?)) ....

[##] Preamble 28 - 'Trembling' for '150 million $ in bitcoin' (?)

[###] 'Trembling' for '150 million $ in bitcoin' - Q & A ...

[>] Q. Wtf you need 150 million $ in bitcoin?
[@ ^ 1.] A1: 'Bonding leverage' ... for 'lipton tea' ...



[>] [ABANDONING_MARTIAL_ARTS_1] 'Tremble' for 'utterly abandoning' 'martial arts' because it's tai-chi that helps with 'untameable-uncontrollable running commentary' && 'getting sick and tired of it' states ... (and that's exactly what happens sometimes with 'crypto-crypto' voice)
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Maybe also 'ground' in 'abandoning martial arts' - themed books (currently 'shibashi' and 'tai-chi' ? (?)) ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ But then again, when you approach an internet-connected pc, whilst in that 'trembling' for 'utterly abandoning' state ... then it's kind of 'undefined' what you are gonna do ... then switching to 'trembling for' 'my leverage trading simulation homebrew sw' ... (before actually approaching that internet-connected pc) ... 

[>] [TIRED_OF_1] When a 'crypto-crypto' voice gets extremely annoying, to the extent that you 'get tired of it' there are even more groundings that have worked at home in the past:
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ { 'Varlakova' ex. && 'Texel-only' chess teacher}  (Existence of 'Socially Proofed' 'Evidence Flipping' people around ... goes beyond 'academic loneliness' ...)
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ With that said, if you're not 'connected' (in some way at least) to 'force factor'  (of 'coersion via physical force') in any way, then obviously (?) (?) (?) amount (and quantity) of 'socially proofed' 'evidence fliping/evidence flips' that is done on you will be 50x more than if you were. 

[##] Assuming you've held onto 'not letting go entirely of martial arts narrative':

[>] Try to bring (in your mind) airdrop hunting/farming (which is a non-methodological non-systematic activity) to tracking-pomodoro-style-on-paper level (tracking 5 minute chunks) ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Again, airdrop farming is still needed because it makes me less dependent on 'not abandoning martial arts narrative' (in a sense, that, if you don't have 8-9k$ in crypto then the importance of 'not abandoning martial arts narrative' becomes increasingly important (for countering r/MenGetRapedToo or whatever)) ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] tbd1,,

[>] ^^ Outside a lot of places are non-vacant, very difficult to find a 'quiet' 'take-a-few-deep-breaths' place (should I need such one) ... (if I need to process sh*t) ... 
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Outside non-vacancy might lead to additional, compounded neurosis (I went there --> somebody's already there! => Ok so let's go there ==> ohh, somebody already is here! ==> ... ==> 'Where where where do I go?!?!?' kind of neurosis (just from statistics))

<script name="tag: suicide_tag_1,, onboarding_psychiatrist_1,,">deleteEmptyLineTry1(document.currentScript);</script>
[#] Misc Notes - Suicide ideations 

[>] ^^ Important dynamic to remember: 'forgot where you shoved your suicidal rope' (as. some 'palpative care patient')

[##] 'Some parts are beyond lifetime to unburden' ...

[>] ^^ Basically, one idea is to remember that 'some parts are beyond lifetime to unburden' (generational trauma) and get into the mindset of 'keep doing the ifs process with my voices until the coma eventually comes' (?) (?) (?) ...
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ And if we 'accidentally manage' to 'unburden' all the burdened parts there's still the endless polarisation in 'blood organ amputation' vs. 'you can't control her brain 100%' (aka. 'count bluebeard' dilemma) ...
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ Q. I know this is not related here but why do you want to study unrelated cults? To study common past cults to be able to 'smell' a cult when I meet one ... ('куда податься куда податься куда податься?!?!? ...') (always ground with books ...) ...
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ So, also in regard to 'parts work' -- even an ifs therapist does have that 'cop' hat (you never know!) ... so it makes sense to ground also in 'dtttp' books and also 'shogi & xiangqi && gobaduk' books !!!

[>] ^^ Watching documentaries about 'big entities' 'governments' 'legal system corruption' ... could help with { 'bridge 3h punishment' && 'geography' } ...

[>] В любом случае когда голова плывет и при отсутствии доступа к крипто -- 'bjj distress grouding' -- да работает ... но есть два 'но' (1) Первое - это как доползти до него -- типа что-то вроде тай-чи, шибаши, и потом колдование на бубнах (?) (?) (?) -- и потом граундинг с 14 упражнениями моше каица пока не смогу доползти до того что и эти все упражнения заскриню из книги и запишу в оффлайн html (of this website). (2) Второе это то что после джиу джитсу есть 'зюгоматиковское похмелье' что после смотрения на себя в зеркало невзначай в лифте -- хочется потом самому сразу и определиться к каневскому (и проклинать там всю жизнь пендоса который на джиу джитсу искалечил мне фотогеничное лицо). (3) Контекст у этого он примерно таков что у ифс-терапевта есть часть 'хоспиталайзинг' 'коп' и когда-то когда у тебя спиздили бутылку с содой -- решал конфликт ты 'пожаловаться санитарам или не пожаловаться' (типа если много 'жалуешься' -- могут и самого посадить в изолятор типа ты создаешь слишком много шума, так вот тебе осивальчик ...) -- только джиу джитсу тебя и спас там тогда --- и ты пересилил себя и пошел и сказал им (самому злостному из санитаров) -- что вот мол товарищ украл у меня бутылку Я просто может вам еще кто-то это уже и сообщал кроме меня вам на заметочку типа. (х/з) ... и (4) (забыл, вылетело из башки, сорри.) ...
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ В любом случае - trying 'bjj' strategy with ifs therapist directly (before being in the room with four men) ... will get you flying 'my way or the high way' due to win-loss dynamic ... so then go has 'territorial' dynamic so maybe try that with an ifs therapist first, ... try to exploit/explore all options ... before you fly into the room with four men (where you're cornered into resorting to bjj with sanitars or others ...) ...

[##] 'Polarisations Never End' - Elaborations ... (on that point (since I'm visiting here one too often ...))

[>] ^^ 'And if we 'accidentally manage' to 'unburden' all the burdened parts there's still the endless polarisation in 'blood organ amputation' vs. 'you can't control her brain 100%' (aka. 'count bluebeard' paradox ...)' ...

[>] [BODYWEIGHT_FITNESS_CONNECTION_1] ^^ As I've thought before, expanding on the difference between 'blood organ existence' and 'blood organ amputation' ... a male might need to plow through hordes of other males and have 'borderline physical altrecation' with them b/c who gives up easily? So in a sense ... sometimes shifting my borderline-suicidal thoughts to 'not abandoning martial arts narrative regardless of 'zygomatic fracture--face assymmetry'' or even something mild like 'bodyweight fitness' ... could potentially help with daily situational 'perplexity' that sometimes occurs in some certain, specific gps locations ... (I mean if you're looking, looking, and cannot find ... maybe want to 'scan' here too as this topic is not intuitively related to neither 'confusion'/'perplexity' nor 'suicide' ... and as we've said before, sometimes causes a burnout of it's own (aka 'bjj-face ==> please hospitalize me, dr kanevsky!') ...

[>] ^^ From my observations, if you do tai-chi kata, but do not visit a 'safe-to-yell' zone that day (or the following day) (is throwing a random past trauma 'first thing that comes to mind' into the river - count? (?)) (regardless of 'crypto') -- then there's 'clog' (in a sense that 'no 50 million depot shots won't help him') (regardless of crypto)... in a sense that you won't be understanding why you can't do now a tai-chi or shibashi and there's perplexity of unknown kind, and things going to shambles ...

[##] 'What's the point?' voice ...

[>] ^^ Some parts take beyond lifetime to unburden ... && 'Tremble' for 'IFS' (sanitars do not necessarily have to subscribe to 'no bad parts' manifesto && they can make you need to earn 100k$ for lipton tea (of testnets beggarship) (instead of 8-9k$))

[##] Q. Old age:
[>] ^^ So you'll live a shorter life, let's say 50 instead of median 80 ... not thinking about 'longer but more sh*tty life' (because that's 'looking into the abyss') ...

[>] ^^ If you're 100 years old and you're drowning -- you'll still be gasping for air (just as if you were 43 years old.).

[>] You might still need 'yourself' to confront the 'random justice' justice system ...

[>] In russia - I'd be probably dead ... so when do you 'stop trying' really?
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ You work with your parts ... and there's infinite work because in the end there is 'medusa wife' vs. 'reproductory repression' polarisation that never gets solved because it's not your own brain that is fully under your command so ...
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ Even if all childhood traumas ideally have been resolved ... there's still that one polarisation that is always actual and needs endless resolving of polarisations (can't control them women 100%, because it's not your own brain ...) ...
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ 'Medusa wife' will know that you don't want to 'amputate' your '21th finger' so she'll use it to extort you ... and there is a 'little' of 'medusa wife' in every woman most likely ...

[>] A body is born with existing, but limited capacities for self-revival ... and when those capacities are depleted (at 30 or at 50 or at 60 or at 80 or at 100 ...) the motor (heart) stops working (or the 'controller module' aka 'bakar' aka 'brain' (or the wiring between 'contoller' and 'motor') stops working ...) and the blood stops getting to the organs and a living organism whose cells need blood (to 'feed' nutrients & oxygen off it ...) ... 'decays into dust'. This might happen at 30 with heavy drug use (happened to some russian female singer I don't remember her name ...) might happen at 50 ... it's just considering all circumstances the average median for males (with average humanoid revival capacities that they are given at birth ...) is about 66.5 years or so ...
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ So it's either you 'play along' with those 'parts' ... or sometimes when parts start overwhelming and you're unable to cope and say 'f*ck yours!' then obviously some other potentially-vital organ starts most likely malfunctioning ... which could lead to 'bad body signals' and/or possibly more 'titanium plates' in various organs etc. But then again ... who said that 'population density' doesn't kill? Were there a 'research'?
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ Anyway, there are unlimited amount of polarisations due to 'reproductory repression' on one end and 'medusa wives' whom you can't 100% control - on the other end.
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ One point that I'm trying to make out of this ... is that I have been 'fatally wounded' in the face/cheekbone ... revival capacities don't care they just keep reviving until they too, get depleted ...

[#] Misc Notes - AI & ChatGPT overwhelm ...

[##] Q&A - Publishing ...
[>] Publishing anything online (incl. ChatGPT responses) has to be at least tangially related to chess (as. Mr. Jay Wacker does in his twitter).

[>] Another filter: when you're about to post something online, replace the wording: 'cohesive singular identity' ==> 'cohesive' + <'what you're about to post'> + 'identity' (and hear yourself how it sounds )...
	
[>] ^^ { Maintaining same level of 'ELO' rating && OpenAI chats (their discord) } HF_1 ...

[>] ^^ Monetary narrative is still above the AI narrative ... they will make it gated and then you need _money_ to query it. (tbd1,,)

[>] ^^ Studying with or from ChatGPT is like googling ... you still want to stay away from it and stay with 'grounding books' ... (for distress states) ... (unless you have your own homebrew chatgpt (you get the drill ...))

[>] ^^ A.I. is not your ifs therapist ... if you glide beyond the boundary of 'IFS book' into google ... that's already a 'no bad parts frame rupture' and you need a _real_ ifs therapist,, do not delude yourself either you can go by without or you can't ... pretending that an A.I. can do it -- is just 'escaping from reality' ...

[>] It's disguised overwhelm nosurf is still the rule ...

[>] Point being, posting responses of chatgpt is an anti-chess rule 'don't give out your chess pieces' ... so chess book & ask chatgpt to help me with coding my own chess/go/shogi/xiangqi/tetris-attack engine? (?)

[>] Proactively 'tremble' for chess teacher due to 'evidence flipping' 'socially proofed' knockos dynamic?

[>] Q. I don't wanna fly, man ... what the f*ck do I do here? (already sh*tposted on both 'ifs discord' and 'r/cults' ...)
[@ ^ 1.] Proposition #1: Ask it only questions related to 'AI theory' and 'Programming' ...
[@ ^ 2.] Idea #2: { 'Programming micro-steps' && 'AI' } hyper-focus ...
[@ ^ 3.] Idea #3: Do not post him any programming excercises made with help of ChatGPT as then I'm unable to control myself and am posting about chatGpt into r/cults, etc. ChatGpt needs to be 'internalized' for a month or three before you could send him (father) programming excercises that you've done with it (chatgpt's help).
[@ ^ 4.] Idea #4: Play chess with chatgpt.
[@ ^ 3.] Any other ideas? (?)

[>] [CHATGPT\_AND_BOOKS_GROUNDIING_1] Since we've talked somewhere above, on why 'calibrating' on 'ChatGPT' is weaker than 'calibrating' on 'one-cent-a-year-narrative' (in a sense of 'resilience' to 'existential overwhelm gaslights') ... ==> [tbd1,,] ==> What are the books between 'casual chats with chatgpt' and 'one-cent-a-year-narrative' (in a sense of a 'connection to one-cent-a-year narrative')? 
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^ 'Elo rating && games complexity' theme ... ('elo rating' is important, mainly for 'shutting up and not shitposting stuff on the internet') 
[@ ^ 1.2.] ^ Beermoney, aka. David Ramsey ... (this is definitely needed to bridge the gap between chatgpt because chatgpt doesn't have no sense of money in it whatsoever it's just a pure mathematics)
[@ ^ 1.3.] ^ Nosurf (digital minimalism) (this is needed as per 'crypto' vs. 'testnets' vs. 'nosurf' ... inconsistency-between-intents-objectives-targets ...)
[@ ^ 1.3.1.] ^^ Насчет intents-objectives-targets -- вот скажем ты сказал что с госпитализацией через 5-6 лет нужно будет 8-9-10k$ а вот если с госпитализацией -- то тогда нужно будет может быть тогда уже 100-200k$ -- как это называется? Это -не 'прицел' ... это ориентация более чем прицел ... рассчет ...
[@ ^ 1.3.1.1.] ^^ То есть это меньше 'прицел' потому что Я не фотогеничный а ориентированность на какой-то диапазон ...
[@ ^ 1.3.1.1.1.] ^^ То есть ты говоришь 'вот-так-вот' лучше -- а вот так-вот хуже ....
[@ ^ 1.4.] ^ Privacy & 'Identity theft' books (someone I speak my passwords aloud (!!!)) ...
[@ ^ 1.5.] ^ R/MenGetRapedPlenty books -- are they the same as 'r/datingoverfifty' books?
[@ ^ 1.6.] ^^ Lawyer books (because chatgpt requries internet & privacy which could, absolutely randomly be taken away from you, by 'legal system' that 'closes cases' sometimes instead of proper justice (at least brandon garret that's what he wrote how the things are, in his book ...))
[@ ^ 1.6.1.] ^^ There are also 'arguments for lawyers' books, etc. Fcking become 'secret identity lawyer 007' if you I mean ... this flesh has experienced it on itself (!!)
[@ ^ 1.6.] ^ Nofap books ('smoking fetish' that makes me a more crippled before every time I have to pee) ...
[@ ^ 1.6.1.] ^^ You can be 'gaslighted' into 'amnesia' ... need favoxil need favoxil need favoxil ... or be that 'gnif' guy ... (tbd1,,)

[>] [GAINS_GMX_1] The road from chatgpt to my own gains.trade clone ... (tbd1,,)
[@ ^ 1.] It starts with acquantying myself better with tools that are available to us?

[>] ChatGPT and minecraft coding (strictly offline homebrew - no crypto - for laptop and android phone my own no-crypto offline apps and scripts)
[@ ^ 1.] C ...

---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ----
[##] ChatGPT and 'Protector Questions for overwhelms' - when even this fails to work ...

[>] ^^ 'Varlakova excercise' ...

[>] ^^ Play Go (which is a 'sturdy boundaries setting' game) with 'IFS Therapists' (in your mind) ...
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Maybe want here some 'baduk loss sootheners'? (?) -- what are those anyway -- those that diminish the 'I've lost too many time -- ooooohhhh, I'm a loser in life' effect (which can sneak up sometimes and make me make some of the more loose boundaries (?)) ... with ifs therapists I suppose there's no 'coercion by force' factor ... almost nonexistent with those types so no 'martial arts for cult leader' here ...

[#] Misc Notes - Father, Psychiatry, Conservatorship, Workability, and ChatGPT (if it ever stays free for that long ...) ...

[##] Preamble - Some 'mental' preparation etc.

[>] ^^ You'll have to deal with 'duper's delight' / 'ухмылка/ехидность' - and hope that your ifs frame is strong enough to sustain (maybe need more context-specific jokes from chatgpt) ...
[@ ^ 1.] Why didn't an immigrant adapt - b/c he was busy learning all the new words. (etc.)

[##] Preamble 14 - Q&A 

[>] Q. If it came down to a choice: either you go to prison or mother or father goes to prison (no other choices) - what would you choose?
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Because mother once said to you 'I don't want to go prison' (whatever that means ...) 
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ (tbd1),,

[>] Q. Самое главное для меня, неважно где Я проживаю - в петах тикве или в гуш агадоле - это - избежать повторной госпитализации как только возможно дольше - так или нет?
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ То есть исходя из моих там типа это самая главна (tbd1,,)


---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ----
[##] Preamble 18 - Describing that main polarization

---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ----
[###] Sub-Section 1.1. - Workability

[>] ^^ In em amoshavot, due to population density, and other factors (which are tbd1,,) -- I won't be able to work as neither 'ifs therapist' nor 'sw dev', 30-40 years from now ...  (But eventually you can learn to dance even around some thinnest pole, but again - estimation so far after being a few years here -- 30-40 years, and even then, every little thing that happens will sway you off for like 10+ years into unemployment, because 'repressed traumas' here are only 'compounding' instead of 'venting' (again, with some magic, after 30-40 years, even that is, m, 'doable', (but after 30-40 years, estimatingly ...)).

[>] ^^ Common keywords are: 'repressed traumas venting ecosphere',, 'catastrophes & disasters' resilience/durability (a catastrophe that would 'cripple' me in petah tikva - would be somewhat less cripling if I was stationed in shore-border-proximity zone (at night you can walk and have a lesser-people-around breather horizon view nearby),, 

[>] Traveling to shore-border-proximity zone, 20+km, on a potentially puncturable tire electric bycicle, esp. during/after a catastrophe -- can definitely be 'prone' to 'rage quitting' ...

[>] There is some 'bad actor' in the building that aggressively 'sabotages' my attempts at chores ... there are also some 'bad actors' and 'jascha heifetz' too ... but they are much less 'aggressive' (and there's 'proximity to shore border' and 'proximity to 'immersive places'' at dawn or night) ...

---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ----
[###] Preamble 25 - Father is not '100% reliable' (it has been noticed on 'multiple occasions' ...) ... - what I can yes somewhat rely on him on, and which I can't expect to rely on him on ... (?) ==>

---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ----
[###] Preamble 31 - My Directives (before communicating with father)

[####] Torevise:

[>] ^^ In em amoshavot, due to population density, and other factors (which are tbd1,,) -- I won't be able to work as neither 'ifs therapist' nor as 'programmer' and hence one of my directives - is - that I am yes interested in becoming 'based' in 'shore-border-proximity' zone. Due to that 'unemployment' (or rather, as 'ifs therapist' or 'programmer' - emplyoment inability factor).

[>] 

---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ----
[###] Sub-Section 1.4. - Talking to him on the phone and then later rolling on asphalt or on the floor

[>] He uses some conversational gaslighting tactics ... bansinster child ...

[>] Q. Когда ты переедешь в квартиру на Яша Хефец?
[>>> 1.1.] A1: Может через 5 программок . Или 10 . Или 20. Но это все так-же зависит от насколько ты намерен переводить каждый раз телефонные разговоры в 'заостренные зоны' ... или ищешь взрывов недопониманий/недоумений и недоразумений.


---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ----
[###] Sub-Section 1.4. - Talking to him on telegram on unrelated topics to programming

[>] Back your 'Ты мне именно так сказал. Я очень хорошо помню.' by making backups. Until I saw some other way out of his mess.

[>] 'Иногда, наши разговоры с тобой по телефону - переходят в 'напряженные зоны'. Ты мне один раз сказал - что ты 'напряженных зон' - тоже не хочешь. Я - со своей стороны - могу предложить, как 'смягчение' таких 'напряженных зон' -- делать тебе упражнения (маленькие) и задачки по программированию. Ты со своей стороны - можешь принять - или не принять - это предложение.'

[>] Any sentence - connect it to 'programming' or 'remotely-similar-to-programming' job. (ok, till you're 67).

[###] Sub-Section 1.3. - Mentioning michael

[>] I can tell him a self-deprecating joke on 'why an immigrant couldn't adapt' but instead, the better option, is for this to serve as an additional push, to make myself 'stationed in shore-border proximity zone' and _only then_ give him those remarks about why he mentions michael in his mail. Make that as an 'additional leverage'. Because again better chance of becoming either an 'ifs therapist' and/or 'by-remote programming teacher' is actually in 'shore-border-proximity-zone'.


---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ----
[###] Sub-Section 1.8. - Programming from the perspective of court of law ...

[>] ^^ [tag: programming_for_court_appointed_expert_witness_tag_1,,]

[>] ^^ In the non-public document ...


---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ----
[###] Sub-Section (?) - (?)
[>] ^^ When I 'had an episode of 'smoking fetish'' -- I thought that,m, being as 'triangulated, engaged, conquering commando-soilder' with parents is 'shameful' ==> and then I've said that yes, here my best chance of resolving this is yes paper communication ==> and then I've said that If I want any paper communication -- first thing that I must write - is dtao (as it (such as: wgpi/wgoi) comes before any paper-writing).
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Tbd, find more context about 'if I only were more considerate with my mother/father' (cptsd attachment trauma) in pete walker and similar academic books.

[##] Misc Notes - If we assume that better is 'horrific pain' than a 'mental fog' (of the 'floating in 'pink'' kind) ...

[>] Life is stringent in such a way, that regardless of what-when-how ... -- when you failed to reach in life a certain 'hallmark' ... it's 'self-finishing' with hard drugs all the way to the end 

[##] Misc Notes (tbd1,,)

[>] ^ People are a horrific dogs to each other ... so they came up with paper-contracts to preserve some sort of 'order' amidst total anarchy ... but what do you do when you're have 'nomenclature burnout'? What do you do then? ==> You hopefully live (or travel to) a 'immigration to ramat aviv was a matter of luck' as residing in 'resort-like zone' helps couter-balance, the, m, 'knocks' ... or again ... that 'dtao' is some sort of half-a**ed sh*t that you still need 'resort-like zone' to counter-balance the, m, 'nomenclaristic-burnout-overwhelm' so you could be able again to write 'paper contracts' 
...

[>] I think this is yes related here, but, first response to 'crypto voice' considering those dire circumstances ... should be 'nosurf book' (& tracking) && 'blockchain book' (& tracking) ...
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ And maybe also 'chess teacher' && 'varlakova' related books ...
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ If you read 'ifs book' then make sure to read also 'did book' as insofar we are a 'patient' to not glide into 'I'm a therapist' zone ... otherwise 'not grounded properly' again ...

[>] ^^ If you already glided into twitter again, then do track (again dire curcumstances). Sometimes tracking it on de-facto paper or document ... is as difficult ...

``` Author Lindsay Gibson defines emotionally immature parenting as typified by a pervasive inability to be present and attentive to the child’s emotional experiences.

According to Gibson, emotionally immature, or self absorbed parents are blind to their children’s emotional word for a variety of reasons, most commonly due to their own abuse and neglect in childhood, as well as trauma, addiction, mental illness etc.

Anyway, for what ever reason, the emotionally immature parent(s) can’t sooth or validate their children’s emotions.

Left to fend for themselves, these emotionally neglected children may adopt an internalizing or externalizing coping style.

Internalizing: refers to the tendency to seek emotional soothing by becoming self-reliant, and retreating inwardly e.g. utilizing psychological defenses and traits such as dissociation and/or creative fantasy for emotional comfort.

Internalizers are vulnerable to trauma depression and anxiety, but are also prone to self awareness, insight and empathy.

Externalizing: refers to the tendency to seek emotional soothing externally in relationships, objects and behaviors.

Externalizers are vulnerable to substance use, emotional outbursts, vandalism, crime etc. but are also prone to hard driving high achievement.

The author reports that internalizers are the ones that typically seek therapy voluntarily, often in their 30’s after a divorce or other relationship problems.

But externalizers end up in therapy too, usually due to legal troubles or substance abuse etc.

In both cases, children of emotionally immature parents ‘grow up quickly’ out of sheer necessity to take care of them selves, or to take care of their parents.

In such cases, childhood offers little advantages and too many restrictions.

These ‘little grownups’ speed towards adulthood and independence, but at a very high price that they only become aware of later in life.

Growing up fast if exciting, but you miss out on important developmentally appropriate milestones and often find yourself behind your peers in someway or another.

Children of emotionally immature parents frequently want to change the way their parents feel.

But the author emphatically warns against this claiming “you can’t change someone who doesn’t want to change”.

The author observers that children of emotionally immature parents often harbor a fantasy that if they can just engage emotionally with their parent, in just the right way, then they will finally be seen and understood, and the parent will change their emotionally neglectful, self absorbed ways.

No!!!

That’s never going to happen.

Take that fantasy and draw a big barsinister through it 🚫.

This fantasy may take the form of endless emotional demonstrations, conversations and confrontations that leave the emotionally immature parents feeing uncomfortable and defensive and leave the adult child feeling wounded and unsupported all over again.

This dynamic often gets reenacted in adult relationships with partners, whereby the adult child of emotionally immature parents seeks out partners who are emotionally similar to their problematic parental relationship.

You know.

That ‘same relationship different person’ cycle.

#Nightmare

The author posits that if theses dynamics go unidentified, unprocessed and unresolved, than they can dominate and ruin your love, friendship and work relationships, and (perhaps most disturbingly) may be transmitted to your children trans-generationally.

The author has TONS of good advice about what can be done. But perhaps most immediately effective are the following.

Boundaries: identify how long you can be in contact with your emotionally immature parent, without loosing your objectivity and without becoming emotionally reactive, and limit your contact with the parent, not to exceed that amount.

Limit your conversations to non contentious topics. And (warning) be prepared for the subject to almost always come back to them.

Accept and Manage: rather than endlessly emotionally engaging with the parent, the author recommends accepting that you can’t change someone else’s emotional reality with yours.

In other words, let go of your fantasy that they will finally see understand your perspective and drop the rope on the emotional tug of war that’s exhausting both of you.

Surrender.

You’ll win by loosing.

Trust me on this one.

The author instead recommends remaining observational and outcome driven.

Observe the parents current level of capacity. Identify achievable, realistic goals you can accomplish together, and stick to those.

This book is LOADED to the gills with wisdom, intelligence and excellent advice (a rarity to be sure).

If you’re curious.

Get it.

If this book is your jam, you will know within the first chapter.

If it is.

Than this book might help you finally find your way home to the sanity and serenity you have been seeking.

Awesome Read 😍 ```

[#] Discernance between 0$ and 150 million $ in bitcoin (or monero) -- as a 'portal of entry' ...

[##] Preamble (even earlier)

[>] [WTF_1] Q. Again, wtf do I even care about the 'discernance between' 0$ and 150,000,000$ ? ==> Again, because, you're facing a realistic threat of second hospitalisation from the family ... and 'onboarding psychiatrist' and 'constant need to smoke specific brand for which the money might not 'add-up' ' do not 'align' well one with another (from the math perspective) ... (?) ===> Which might mean that still, regardless of all 'defences' I've built, the 'onboarding psychiatrist' might still 'dig out something' for which even 'james duane''s tactic might fail to work ... (I'm just being honest with all my parts here no more no less)
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ And then on the other hand, I could 'care less' about 'second psychiatric hospitalisation' because I 'enjoy' 'rape in prison' in various specific moments ... and yet the discernance between 0$ and 150,000,000$ is what helps me 'snap out' (because eventually even though _situationally_ I might not care about prison, I might care about needing 100k$ later instead of 8-9k$ if I've 'been to the hospital' for second time) (this is more 'palpatable' to me, than that, 'glamorised prison' which is always being super-glamorised in all kinds of 'tv series' (or whichever leads me to situationally believe that 'prison' is better than 'freedom' ...) ...) ...

[##] Preamble (earlier) - What activities are good for 'palpating the difference' between 0$ and 150,000,000$ and what activities are 'not as good' (tbd1),,

[>] Maybe sometimes (some days yes, but some - not) I can discern between 'prison' and 'freedom' in my mind via such methodic: Ask myself: Can I sense the difference between 0$ and 150 million $ ? ==> Can I sense the difference between '8-9k$' (that was stolen by Do Kwon) and 100k$? ==> Can I sense the difference between 8-9k$ and 100k$ pertaing to 'bonding leverage' that is needed to go & buy lipton tea? ==> It might be that though I cannot sense the difference between prison & freedom (and could care less),, -- I still might be able to sense that difference via 'approximation' that I might be needing now now 100k$ for lipton tea bonding leverage, after being in prison, instead of 8-9k$ ... (so maybe that how I could sense the pain of being in prison, and hence at least try to avoid it ...)

[###] Subsection 1.1.: Good-fit activities for 'palpating the difference' ...

[>] So let's suppose that I don't do any more f*cking lottery airdrops/testnets and stay with just 100$ and mining. And then there's that 'crypto crypto' voice that gets overwhelming sometimes, and yet in some certain scenarios, such as let's say some catastrophic situation at home, some weird burnout state, or some smoking-fetish-overdose - I cannot live the petah tikva house for a few days ... what then do I do with that 'crypto crypto' voice/part? Maybe write a hive.blog post? But that's directly just like 'stepping into shitstorm' which xyk taught me is the most thing that I want to avoid at all costs (et-cetera) ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ So what then are some good-fit activities? (?)

[>] Maybe some sort of 'airdrop uncloggance tracking' in some sort of 'offline diary' could somewhat hopefully indirectly help with '5000 depot shots won't help him' situations ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ With that said, I feel huge urges to post (I still don't have those 8-9k$) so maybe ChatGPT could help with abstaining from shitposting in some way that I haven't yet, m, discovered ...
[>>> 1.2.] ^^ In other 'mental emotional overwhelm' times (or days) I binge-consume twitter so those two activities might 'complement' one another ...

[>] ^^ Checking your cosmos wallet balance -- is it a good-fit activity? ==> Seems, ok, though might be not enough (just like, yeah, how many times a day you can check your wallet).

[###] Subsection 1.2.: Not-so-good activities for 'palpating the difference' ...

[>] ^^ Working on draft of some hive.blog journalism post that will earn me 0.68$ -- is it a good-fit activity? ==> The upside is that it is, with a high probability,  'systematic & methodological' (especially with emergence of ChatGPT and Crayon (which allows to publish generated images with 20% cut))
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ But again, this is an 'overkill' for palpating ... will 'drown' in abyss ... it still, unfortunately has that, m, 'probability' and 'uncertainty' factor which I very much do not like. (?) 

[>] ^^ Selling nft's of crayon on some marketplace ... you've put in on opensea ... so let it stay there ... they are idiots anyway because they do not have a section of 'newly submitted arts' or something like that ... so it goes into 'making my own opensea clone' whilst preceding it in the queue is 'making my own gains.trade' clone ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ This is a 'burnout' activity ... this is for 'hobby' and trauma venting only ... just generate and collect on hd ..

[##] Preamble 2 - Shore Border relation

[>] ^^ Obviously a 'real' discernance is 1000x better than a 'thought-up' discernance, in a sense that if you got a chance to travel to a gps location where such discernance is 'natural' then obviously by all means you should take up on that chance, as it might shine new light on your transition to another appartment or lack thereof.
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ We've said, in 'shore_border_tag' section, that, after 72 hours ... that basically, the idea of visiting ramat aviv every 72 hours, is because (1) If I delay it for 'too long' then traveling there - even after 48+ hours of staying there nearby (or near) (or adjacent to) the seashore -- I still won't be able to find a difference between prison and freedom (*1) ... and will fall asleep uncontrollably (*2) ... and then I will be forcefully taken! (which is unwanted? (?) (<-- haha! lol! ... --> see (*3),(*4) --> lol! lololololololololol!) 
[>>> 1.1.1.] (*1) ^^ (similar things happened where I couldn't, bluntly in-your-face watching the sea and standing literally near it at night, snap out of, the thought that 'prison is better than freedom' into 'freedom is better then prison') ==> ... so how come this then couldn't come to 'being unable to dissect even after just f*cking 48+ hours staying there' (if I delayed 'myself' in petah-tikva for 'too long'?)) ???
[>>> 1.1.2.] (*2) (like also happened in yaar bon (I just said f*ck it - I'm laying down wtf ja! ja! - aaand so I did ... and woke up at ~ 7 pm (luckily no one noticed a near-homeless person lying on the ground ...))
[>>> 1.1.3.] (*3) (and then though, it might require some bueracracy to get out they might 'test' me there for half a year ... one thing is when I myself get 'напасти' and going and trying to snap out ... the other thing entirely is when other people are directly involved and are 'supervising' my 'snapping out' process,) ... (tbd1,,)
[>>> 1.1.4.] (*4) also I just 'vaguely' remember that no matter what you think _now_ under mild tobacco influence & possibly some other lsd-like toxins that they 'secretly' 'shoved' there,, but after you resided in the same room with 4 foreign people the 'serial humiliation' dynamic (like in handesaim with 'roi') slowly started to 'sneak in' and you wanted out of there like 'off the hot stove' ... so again ... it might be possible that some lsd-like substances in Pall Mall Blue are doing that to me (this 'unable to discern between 'prison' and 'freedom' states) ...
[>>> 1.2.] ^^ Point being that even that ability of being able to 'focus' on some 'document' or it's text (in this case it's 'difference between 0$ and 150 million dollars) and simultaneously 'induce trembling' together with that focusing -- is also some sort of 'magic' that is not guaranteed and could be also 'squashed' if you don't travel outside to catch the 'real' discernance between 'prison' and 'freedom' (and not 'thought-up' discernance like we've been here doing all day). 
[>>> 1.3.] ^^ Need a functioning alarm clock in the f*cking house!

[##] Preamble 3 - 

[>] If 'crypto', 'anonymous crypto' is important -- then, m, secruity of passphrases and also then hence computer security is important which is also a 'lifetime process' securing your data whilst new techs emerge so maybe could be broken into '5 minute' pomodoro tasks (ChatGPT is offline right now, sorry).

[##] Preamble 2 - 

[>] One key point: When I have more than 150 million $ in bitcoin, only then airdrop (in a sense that too 'greedy' ( 'greedy' / 'acquistive' / 'grasping' ) is not good too, but, if we're talking about some people wealth ...)
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ I may airdrop, but again, till the balance goes below 150 million $ then I have to get back to 150 million $ .... (or something) ...

[>] ^^ With that '150 million $' price tag named, there are some things that it would cost 30,000,000,000 $ (or 30 bn $) in losses, if you talked about them.
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Minecraft (building block in 'endless' 32-bit minecraft) symbolises metaphorical way out of some sort of 'rut' or 'post-catastrophe-rut' or 'post-trauma-rut' and 'pomodoro' coding desireable (or 'barely palpatable desireable') minecraft features with help of ChatGPT (or GPT) also most likely in the same fashion symbolises metaphorical climbing out of those kind of a rut. 

[##] Preamble 50 

[##] Preamble 20 - 

[>] Basically sometimes in 'deep' 'twilight zones' I must somehow 'palpate' that balance ... testnets (which are 'lotteries' are supposedly somewhat maybe problematic from some aspects, but they allow me to 'palpate' that difference) ...
[@ ^ 1.] The most correct (and less 'gamblish') to remove the scary 'gambler-loser element' in that aspect would be probably 'plan as much as possible in advance (via, say, a 'pomodoro technique' of next day's 20-30 minutes) ...' and only then perform as planned ... so it's like { 'trembling' for 'testnets pomodoro' } (?)
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ Some opportunities will be missed this way, but hey, opportunities will always be missed b/c crypto information overwhelm requires individual to be active 25 hours per day to keep up with all those twitter announcements (with who know what when the next aptos airdrop will come from).

[##] Misc afternotes - on dtao ...

[>] [DTAO\_1] Maybe move this from here: Basically there's always going to be a need for dtao: either it's wgwaw/wbwaw (reproductory hyper repression, penis is a blood organ) or a 'medusa wife whom you cannot control her brain' (wgj(enny)s(tay)/wgj(enny)g(one)) ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ So it's like what? Either you're slacking on it and then you're in the 'realm of hungry ghosts'? (?)

[>] [DTAO\_1] ^^ Dtao, if needed, has 3 components: shibashi/tai-chi/<unclear if chin-na verification is 100% always needed>,, chess && tetris attack,, stephane && varlakova ...

[>] [DTAO\_AND_COMPUTER_SECURITY_1] ^^ So, now, I want to be 'comfortable' even on an 'infected laptop' (some of my family members are tech-savvy) ... to be able to write 'dtao' ... so henceforth a 'pomodoro' research into 'ransomware' && 'keyloggers' && 'extreme privacy' && 'identity theft' landscape (as an observer) is somewhat correlated to dtao (?)

[>] Dtao has 3 components, { 'tai-chi' & 'shibashi' } && { 'chess & tetris-attack & story-based rpgs' } && { stephane varlakova and ifs } which means that supposedly ifs book could help with dtao stuckness? (?) (?) (?) 
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ It's important to read 'did book' after 'ifs book' for 'grounding' ... so far the perespectives for becoming an ifs therapist are dim.

[##] Misc afternotes - not necessarily related specifically to 'discernance ability'


[>] Polarisation: on one hand I desperately need 8-9k$ ... on the other hand I'm saying that any sort of aggressive money earning is a no-go (only speculative airdrops hunting which is so un-methodological and/or un-consistent) 
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Am I reenacting trauma of some sort here? (?)

[>] ^^ First and foremost, imo, should be 'making gains.trade clone' over 'pomodoro airdrops', as having { '100$ + mining' && 'gains.trade' } is very, very helpful in regard to 'portals for reentry' ...

[>] ^^ Maybe somebody very rich is living in this appartment building -- which raises in me the need to 'palpate' all the time, the, m, 'difference between 0$ in bitcoin and 150 million $ in bitcoin) (what a 'hellish hell'!!!!!!!!! ...)

[##] Preamble 1 - tbd1,,

[>] Besides the natural disasters in this life (earthquakes and such) ... there's this "if you grew up, and in the process of growing up you didn't hit a certain 'bar' or a certain 'threshold' or a certain 'mark' or a certain 'standard' -- you will die a horrific death from consequent self-drugging ... in my case the standard I didn't hit is probably some sort of (1*) { "height median" compared to average israeli men's "height median" } and on top of it there being "war in russia" that makes it very hard to impossible to come back to it ... and even if, even if, ... somehow miraclously I manage to win a lottery and somehow an 'advanced medical AI' fixes my height with some super-duper stem-cell bone-regenerating breakthrough ... -- then I still yet didn't hit another 'mark' or 'standard' and that is { 'you're of late age' } ... and then you're still self drugging into death (all the, m, 'ifs magics' aside ...) ... or ... or ... --- the distance/ice is 'sooo thin' that you're 'just never-ever-ever going to make it' [a super-painful sharp emotion (you know what I'm talking about here ...) ...], and going to 'shut down' on it all because it's 'too neurotic' already as in in that 'yeltishevi' story about that old woman wondering 'when will the death come already when will the death come already ... et cetera et cetera' ... because it was 'too neurotic' for her to need to 'open up' again and again as per 'do not go gently into that good night rule' ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ and, ..  m, .. 'human masturbation' will always 'remind me' of that 'standard' that I didn't end up to hit ... 
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ So in a sense a books diet or some other 'less informational noise' diet helps to survive this 'sharp emotion' better and be less crippled by the consequent self-drugging outbursts or tongue-slip verbal outbursts ... (because it's just so harsh is life ...)
[>>> 1.1.1.1.] ^^ One point to emphasize ... is that masturbation will always remind you of that 'standard' or 'mark' you failed to meet ... with a ultra sharp emotional contrast (that is kind of similar to a worm, when he's pinned with a needle to the ground or something ...) ...
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ One point to also emphasize, is that this emotion is so sharp and paralyzing sometimes, that once surfaced, you, m, don't really care about hospitalisation or anything ... it's more like please somebody take me away from this faulty non-standards-meeting human-body that I'm somehow ended attached to ...
[@ ^ 2.1.] ^^ So I suppose some sort of more dp-dr books, or even his 'in the realm of hungry ghosts' book et cetera ... (?) ... stories of (or about) 'survivors' who 'didn't meet the harsh life 'standards' or 'marks' and then end either self-drugging themselves or ...' ... ya know ... finding 'refuge' in 'sympathizing' / 'commiserating' with other 'self-drugging 'survivors'' on an as deep level as possible (via lesser-toxic-books as compared to more-toxic-reddit) ...

[>] Или ты будешь целовать ново-купленную графическую карту (или ново-купленный вентилятор (для двух карт)) -- или ты будешь целовать чьи-то пятки ... твой выбор ...

[##] Onwards, 1:

[@ ^ 2.] ^^ I somehow manage to buy from aliexpress and fix myself? (?)
[@ ^ 3.] ^^ EVMOS goes up (G-d knows ...) ... (?)

[>] Maybe it's still possible to get by with just tai-chi and dtao ... as we've bought that 1050ti videocard as a 'waiting game' till they buy an appartment, but now they have bought it. So maybe worst come to worst I could still get by somehow without a videocard, whilst realistically understanding, that there's a very low probability, _if_ I don't gamble, that I'll have less than 100$ in bitcoin, within the next 5-10 years.
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Though hopefully one micro-step a day and 'not abandoning' the issue entirely, could help even more with that eventually converging to 100$ (within a few months ...) ... maybe I need pomodoro time tracking a-la chatgpt here ...

(and possibly (2) 'blue metal safe box' bankrupcy?) (and possibly (3) needing eventually 100k$ instead of 8-9k$? in do kwon's money?))

[##] Preamble 34 - 
[>] ^^ Posting on the 'cults' and 'ifs' forums (aka the whole shebang of 'sokal-hoax, tyler, eckhart, antman, jay wacker, did, cptsd, how ifs came to be') will put you into psychiatric institution (borderline) without anyone else putting you into psychiatric institution ... because with 'lack of energy && forgetful rather' (and maybe other things) you will have difficulty to sustain a 'cohesive singular identity' by yourself, without anyone putting you to any psych ward intentionally ...

[>] ^^ Posting on evmos discord or any other crypto or crypto-airdrops related chat -- if this 'slipped' ... then something with parents will also 'slip' ... and then hospitalisation will cost you as you've said the difference between needing '8-9k$' for 'lipton tea' vs. 'needing 100k$' for 'lipton tea' aka. approximately ~ 90k-200k$ in monetary losses.

[>] Masturbation doesn't care whether you've immigrated from putin to petah-tikva and what how who happened ...

[>] There's a 'self-disciplining inconsistency' problem in petah-tikva (or 'beyond self-disciplining') state ... it has to do with inability to discern between 'prison and freedom' and hence you can't say that if you do something that other parts don't like then we'll write 3h punishment on paper because since prison equals freedom then the word 'punishment' is kind-of sort-of erased from the vocablulary ... it doesn't exist there ... in a sense of 'what punishment?' -- 'I don't care about any punishment whatsoever' -- 'In fact, I enjoy rape in prison!' ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Henceforth masturbations 'roam freely' in such context and some other parts don't like that if you limit the 'outside gps locations' exposure, only to 'evenings' ... they ask ... wtf, getting outside if masturbation could be prevented, was 'cheaper' than 'waiting for the evening to get outside' ...

[>] ^^ Immigration to ramat aviv was a matter of luck!!!

[>] ^^ Like I said, tetris-attack can palpate the crawl to ifs therapist (and the risk of meeting the 'cop' part of an 'ifs 'crook' therapist') because sometimes namecalling parts get intolerable, and propel me onto crawling towards an ifs therapist ...

[>] ^^ Basically the gist is, that, 'idiot savant' is one who doesn't notice patterns,, and playing tetris attack can calm namecalling parts,, and yet when you 'aggressively dwell on pattern matching' w/tetris-attack, then also you find the 'traumas' patterns ... and henceforth it is helpful to play some sort of piano and guitar sootheners (and maybe others too (?)) ....

[>] ^^ Because with 'onboarding psychiatrist' or with 'police' you want to as quickly as possible, get to writing on paper as is detailed in uncle james' book .. because again, it leaves less room for doubt amidst 'suspiciously nervous' / 'suspiciously calm' vastness/abyss ... and because you said yourself that most likely after being in prison or in ward it's going to be needed probably 100k$ for lipton tea bonding leverage instead of just 8-9k$ and is going to be much more difficult to get.

[#] Paper notes - Q & A (trhhhhhh)

Preamble:
[>] IMO, proper paper disposal depends on studying books of go, xiangqi, and shogi ... (with whatever resources are available to you)
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ And also reading 'games human complexity' papers, but exclude chess (even if it is the most complex game there is (because there's a huge traumatic injury associated with it ('e.g. 'wtf have you told' critic that bloodily spirals out of control and makes me self-hospitalize (and then say bye-bye to any 'longhand paper' whatsoever ...) ... ) ...) ...

[>] Dtao pages that are older than one year old - are properly ok to dispose of (unless there are notes in them) (f*cking make my tooth rot).

Onward, 1: 
[>] Q. Where do I shove paper notes?
[@ ^ 1.] ^ For the sake of transition to 'lesser urgency flipping' gps - first objective is to move them off paper (so he won't be able to easily access) into _this very document_ because beyond this document I'm getting lost in filesystem (there's section below this one which is called 'grounding paper notes')
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^ Then later, if you ever feel that this document grows beyond 500MB - then move them randomly into diary ... (as we do sometimes just randomly select 5 fkn notes and move them -- f*kn distress in petah-tikva - don't you see?!?!?) ....
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ The rationale being -- that _if_ I wrote them on paper (and not to here - instantly) then it was some sort of an emergency (otherwise why would I write them on paper and not to here straight into some db on fs? etc) .. and moving them 'at least somewhere' in computer ... make this 'less emergency' than it originally 'were' ...

[#] Misc Notes - Grounding Paper Notes - Transferred here (tbd1,,) (this should probably be in the end of the document)
// [#] Paper Notes - Nowehere to shove before I throw the paper page to garbage -- last ditch attempt

Preamble:
[>] Sometimes, when in huge 'petah-tikva' distress - and I cannot find my 'path' to this document -- I'm using paper for grounding. To find my path to this document. Back to this document. And sometimes this paper wants 'notes' to be 'transferred' somewhere -- so hope, that this section could serve as an intermediary -- to be able to dispose of paper and not accumulate that clog, and in 10 years, when I finally will be f*cking able to move to ramat aviv -- to dissolve it from here to other f*ckking places -- but first - get rid of the goddamn clog. Thank. You.
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Again, with 'r/mengetrapedplenty' in mind ... ==> accumulation of paper clog will eventually lead to a state similar to '5000 depot shots won't help him' and is very likely yes a 'red flag' that I should try and plow through and deal with (with the 'paper clog' ...) ...

Jose Ortega y Gasset said the metaphor is the most powerful tool known to humankind I'll bet many of the negotiators and mediators on this call have had the
experience of how a well timed well chosen and evocative metaphor can help unlock the dispute resolution process ... this metaphor of parts is not new Plato
had the notion that we have parts to the two horses the positive and the negative energies and the charioteer the tries to manage them Freud of course thought we
had parts the ideo and super-ego the idea that we have parts is one that scholars in our field have been writing about of late billiary Erica Fox Garry Friedman all of these books take as their premise that we are engaged in an internal negotiation all the time all of us and the people that we work with as well ... this article from several years ago 1998 by Max bazerman and colleagues is a wonderful introduction to this concept in this article the authors talk about us having basically two cells the want self which is impulsive and the should self which is rational in this a more recent article by Bob Borden and colleagues talking about how the internal negotiation over our identity and role plays an important function in our negotiations and then in the materials the for this talk you may have seen a link for this article and also for this shorter article and when you get the slides if you want to access these articles you'll have links to them finally in terms of this being a a model that is out there in the world if you have not seen the Academy award-winning movie inside out I encourage you to see it it depicts each of the people in the
film it's an animated film with these five parts inside who are negotiating all the time over what each of the protagonists in the in the film are going to to do it's both entertaining and enlightening and it was actually developed with some help from one of the psychiatrists in the IFS field ...

[#] Tracking time spent on airdrop hunting (in 5 minutes chunks) (so you couldn't say that you're not hunting and no chance of future airdrops)

[>] ^^ So you couldn't say that you're not hunting and no chance of future airdrops ...

Preamble 1: 
[>] I agreed for 100$ BTC .. without further airdrop hunting, with condition that we are going to be actively developing minecraft -- otherwise 'all holes are going to be, m' ruptured again ... you say that, m, airdrop farming is inconsistent and non-systematic -- then f*cking do minecraft till the last whim of yours ... including portals, encryption, searchability, android, webgl, everything ...
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Simply reading all opengl and mod programming books (3 times) -- make the curve 'less steep' ... are you able to code in opengl like you are able to code in autohotkey? (whilst google searching only for 'things that you did in the past but just don't recall?) ... probably not ... because you don't have a lot of 'hands-on experience' with aforementioned having done all the possible 'tutorial pilots' ...
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ And I need this experience for 'disaster handling', for 'abysses'/'vastnesses' ... and future things that will 'sweep me off my feet' (in a bad sense of a word ...) ...
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ Monetary stuckness has a lot to do with this. So how many time did you invest today in minecraft?

[>] Minecraft 'sweeps me off my feet': [@ ^ 1.1.] 'Comfy Minecraft' existence helps with 'disaster handling',, for 'abysses'/'vastnesses' (in a bad sense of a word) that I meet in life ... and future natural (or or of other origin) disasters that will 'sweep me off my feet' (in a bad sense of a word ...) ...

[>] [MINECRAFT_REDUCING_STEEPNESS_1] Minecraft helps with beyond-self-disciplining in absense of 8-9k$ ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Reading and re-reading books steepens curve up to an extent of being able to code-up-a-feature-in-5-minutes like with autohotkey (remember how you were reading C book in электричка?)
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ Since airdrop hunting is mostly sporaidic and non-methodological ... minecraft is at least I can see how it can be methodological ... in a sense that I have inherent confidence that if I re-read minecraft book 5 times then I will be able to code minecraft features that I need without 'magic tricks' and 'игра на бубнах' (aka. 'conjuring-grade-activities' which is yes prevalent in airdrop hunting activities)

[>] [PERPS_PRACTICE_MODE_1] Practiced Gambling mode -- watching the prices of my 'fake' market positions swing up and down - helps me 'snap out' of some 'depressive/bad/disoptimistic/pessimistic' states ... and yet this feature can disappear at any time ... off the face of the internet ... so in that sense, again, tbd1,,

[>] ^^ Obviously not forgetting 'gmx.io' clone ...

[>] [PREFER\_TESTNETS\_1] If still slipping (unable to record 'time spent on airdrop hunting' into this document very very precisely) - prefer interacting with testnets rather than real monetary transactions (and also, dive straight into testnets, instead of 'reading guides' (because (1) reading is a headf*ck (2) lottery is a lottery (they might drop just 0.4$) ...

[>] [TALKING_ABOUT_PERPS_PRACTICE_MODE_1] Do not ask gains.trade about practice mode ... this will obviously make our situation worse ... what will simply happen is we will just go back into simpler airdrop farming but let's just not look into abyss ... in a sense that maybe by then a big flix/evmos airdrop will happen that will cover my 8-9k$ ... but maybe they will keep it for 5 years ... (who knows?) ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Definitely whatever they answer to me now regarding their plans is just an 'empty promise' and they can change it at any moment should they so desire -- not your website -- not your practice mode.

[>] [DO_NOT_GIVE_OUT_YOUR_CHESS_PIECES_FOR_FREE_1] Before interacting with internet (because you get sudden 'posting urges' out of the blue) (and especially also after those 'sudden posting urges'), touch-read some book on chess/go/xiangqi/shogi (as in. do not give out your chess pieces 'why does he never talk? Is he spying on us?') ...

[>] [EXPECTATIONS_1] So, basically, what can I really expect (with those 'let's check da twitter' style 'slips'):
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Basically, testnets are not going to be done much because of 2 reasons: (1) To fully complete a testnet - I need 20-30 minutes,, (2) Some testnets pay you 0.4$ for a hour's work (e.g. evmoswap)

[>] [MORE_EXPECTATIONS_1] So, again, with the paragraph above (what I can't really hope to expect) -- what can I yes expect?
[@ ^ 1.] Random discord roles with heavily funded projects (Across airdropped to discord roles),, random genesis nfts (games, aptos, etc.),, singular transactions on heavily funded networks (not tens of transactions) on a single wallet,, tbd1,,

[@ ^ 2.] [STUDY_PAST_PROMINENT_AIRDROPS_FOR_FURTHER_CALIBRATION_1] ^^ Some airdrops happened due to simple things such as joining a discord, claiming a role at some certain point, and that's it. (Study past big airdrops. See across airdrop. ...). So this could theoretically happen whilst browsing chats & twitter (sometimes there is some 'genesis monkey nft' to claim ... sometimes there is some minimal discord role claim,, (tbd1,,)) ..

[>] [TESTNETS\_TRANSACTIONS_STUCK_MADNESS_1] Undefined time to completion of an atomic-micro-step (Testnets transactions stuck madness) ==> Obviously this shouldn't 'suppress'/'repress' all my day ... got to put some 'hard cap' here ... if 10 times a transaction didn't go through, then try the next day -- or, f*ck this testnet and it's 'promised' incentives!
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Transactions stuck on someone else's testnet without ever knowing ETA for a fix - is an 'overwhelm'.
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ 'Burnout / overwhelm' and 'one-cent-a-year' are 'misaligned narratives.
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Try another testnet instead? (there are like 5 active testnets ongoing in any existing moment) (?)

[>] [OVER_THE_DAYS_PLEASE_1] Let's try to stick, if possible to the narrative that any testnet & airdrop activities should be done over-the-days and what's not possible over-the-days -- is f*cking lost! Unless it's a _definite_ (not a 'speculative') loss of more than 100$ ... (e.g. if veHarbor is more than 100$).
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ E.g. if kuwa NFT claim ends tomorrow - then f*ck it! In that sense that we want to get to 8-9-20k$ within next 5-6 years (2022) and not go batshit crazy from airdrop jerky-hunting.

[>] Q. So theoretically any airdrop farming should be supressed, because it's non-systematic and non-methodological, right?
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ A1: There's 'one cent-a-year' is better than 'zero-cents-a-year' narrative ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ A1.1.: Currently, mining (*cough* *cough* 'gaming' card) supplies that narrative ... so you should keep insisting and asking them for it under guise of 'I'm overgambling', 'My interest to programming was provoked by gaming in childhood', etc etc etc. (or something along those lines ...)
[>>> 1.2.] ^^ A2: Without { '1 cent a year' is bigger than '0 cents a year' } I am getting lost in my programming -- don't know what am I programming for whom and from whom and for what purpose (at least under specific certain gps locations I am) ...

[>] [CHESS_AND_CRYPTO_TWITTER_1] If you feel like you're about to post some comment on crypto twitter (or crypto telegram) just suggesting that maybe it makes sense to play offline some 'deeper strategy games' so as per 'not give out chess pieces freely' narrative ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Twitter comments definitely stink if not because 'internet is read only' && 'boundaries are washed' narrative ... (tbd1,,)

[>] [MARTIAL_ARTS_AND_CRYPTO_TRY_1] ^ When you say that 'crypto should ideally be reduced to mining only' (because the rest is non-methodological/non-systematic ...) and henceforth unable to get to 8-9k$ in the near future ... then 'not abandoning martial arts narrative' continues to occupy central/ultra importance.
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Btw if you're in an 'urgency flipping' mode, in a sense that 'ultra importance' or 'central importance' sounds like to be 'flipped' (in a sense that 'I enjoy rape in prison' wtf wtf) -- then our only friend here is r/MenGetRapedToo which could ground is in a belief or sensation that 'rape in prison' is definitely not enjoyable.

[>] Насчет конзистентности ... вот бывает такое что броузишь этот чат 'DropsEarn.ru' и типа через 5 минут броузинга типа говоришь: 'чзх!?!?!?!' и уходишь из этого чата, как Емельяненко ушел от Джефа Монсона ... так-что консизтентности тут никакой н*х не ожидай - что типа быть 'конзистентным с тестнетами' ... 'если начал -- закончить' ... н*хуя ... 
[@ ^ 1.] Просто по моему лучше тратить это время на 'разрешение поляризаций' они и так бесконечны. 
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ What about 'bonding leverage' then? (for lipton tea)
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ 'Disruptive technologies' && 'people are slowly catching up' -- work in this area, might serve as a 'bonding leverage' aka. give me that 'rite of passage' for 'lipton tea'? (I mean beside mining card  ...)
[@ ^ 1.1.1.1.] ^^ Just f*cking tired of hunting airdrops that are worth 0.4$ in the end. I mean serverously. (?)
[@ ^ 1.1.1.1.1.] ^^ 'Tremble' for 'key portals for reentry' ... crypto is definitely a 'distress states' & 'trauma unresponsiveness' soothener ..
[@ ^ 1.1.1.1.1.1.] ^^ But still, hours of testnets for 0.4$ - oh, mama.
[@ ^ 1.1.1.1.1.1.1.] ^^ What about 'one-cent-a-year' is better than 'zero-cents-a-year' narrative? (?)
[@ ^ 1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.] ^^ Ideally, there's a 'mining&folding card' that earns me 1 cent a year ... then there's a 'vastness of incentivised testnets' which earn you 0.4$ for 2 hours work ... then there's if you're 'able' to 'skip' this 'ocean' of 'testnets' ... again systematic & methodological coding of, m, let's say your competitor to drift on solana (with practice mode) (like another 'alternativeto.net' clone people will 'ape in' still due to a fancy ui) ...
[@ ^ 1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.] ^^ Bla bla can't 'jump over' this 'vastness' ... so far thought of { 'ELO Rating' && 'one-cent-a-year-narrative' } hyper-focus (I'm on a brink of madness, btw)

[>] Значит нарратива 'one-cent-a-year' она помогает мне против 'global existenital gaslighting' ... в плане того что типа если кто-то 'наезжает' на мою простую нарративу { 'Я зарабатываю один цент в год' и это лучше чем зарабатывать '0 центов в год' } -- то тогда он собака проклятая, сволочь которую расстрелять мало. Или по другому все на меня будут срать и нету конца этому (и Я буду хавать и хавать и хавать и превращусь в реального 'DID' without lacking any cohesive singular identity whatsoever in an forever-irrepairable-sense (or 200+ years needed-to-repair sense) (like e.g. yossi balas or someone similar to him)). Но с другой стороны она никого не обижает эта нарратива -- 'Я никого не оскорбляю тем что есть у меня скажем 150 миллионов $ в биткоине анлесс он триангулирован чтобы дошибить конкретно именно меня без всякой на то обоснованной существующей причины' (просто потому что он злостный мститель неизвестно и непонятно за что итп) -- (но даже тут бл*ть есть - заработать 150 миллионов в биткоине - и только потом эирдропить -- то есть н*ххой прижимают и здесь ! (!!!)) -- и видимо по этому (потому что тогда замечаешь кто на*бвается на тебя безо-всякой-на-то-причины фокусируясь на уан-цент-а-йиар-наррайтив) эта нарратива и удерживает меня удерживает от того чтобы вообще сойти окончательно с ума и стать помешанным каким-то челом (несмотря на лысину, зуб, итп.) -- потому что начинаешь тогда замечать 'bad actors' (а так, если ученный безобидный невинный математик -- то вообще не замечаешь) ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ В дополнение - шахматы они важны здесь тоже почему? Потому что какая-то странная вещь происходит -- вот мол Я рассказал папе или виталику про тетрис аттак -- и вдруг ни с того ни ссего Я его начал 'отвергать' и играть мне в него больше не хочется ... так же может произойти и с крипто нарративой '1-цент-в-год лучше чем 0 центов в год' -- что вдруг неподозревая это сам, Я и это вдруг начну 'отвергать' (или что-то тому подобное) и тогда 'накроется' т.е. не будет у меня спасительной сетки 'safety net' от того чтобы совсем окончательно не помешаться рассудком. И это связанно с тем что помня про шахматы ты не забываешь (надеемся) помнить 'что отдавать шахматные фигуры' -- это болит потом дико (через несколько дней) (как было в бейт шахмат когда-то). Чтобы нечаянно ненароком не рассказать а потом пеняй на себя сам типа итп ...

[>] [CRYPTO_HELPS_WITH_PROGRAMMING_1] Also important to note that 'anonymous crypto' in combination with 'one-cent-a-year-narrative' gives a 'price tag' to my programming whereas earlier I needed to 'write a shareware programs' with dubious ('why the f*ck should I even pay for software' debates that I myself had and probably other people would also have) but now, with crypto, the connection between 'indie programming' and 'money' is much more apparent (such as 'write a leverage trading dex' or 'write an splinterlands/brown-dust style rpg game') ... and hence makes it less affectable to various disasters etc. that could potentially 'sweep me off my feet' (in a bad sense of the word) ... be like gnif (https://web.archive.org/web/20221206221837/https://hackaday.com/2017/10/31/10-year-old-bug-crushed-by-hacker-on-a-mission/)

[>] As far as things go right now, airdrop time tracking comes even before writing dtao ... 

[##] When crypto transactions are not possible (and 'grounding' via 'airdrop pomodoro tracking' doesn't work)

[>] ^^ Probably the second best bet is making your own (or improving on) chess/baduk/shogi/xiangqi engine (with the help of chatGPT) ... (and/or pondering about it) ... do you need time tracking there? G-d knows.
[@ ^ 1.] Theoretically speaking, there are always 'subtle' (or 'not-so-subtle') boundaries between males ... and ... with 'ifs', under all 'books' and 'vast trees of theory' - they are 'still to be found' ... which is not to my advantage because when I 'find' those boundaries, I will be probably 'subservient' which might be 'ok' (richard schwartz also needed other therapists at some points) but not 'ideal' (especially if you're locked-in with him for a longer term). (why did I write this? (?)) ... 
[@ ^ 2.] Building chess engine or app from scratch is more important than building an OS from scratch, because of it's relatedness to sporaidic 'tongue slips' which could be rather fatal to us. 

[>] Q. How is chess/go/shogi/xiangqi is ever related to 'ever-existing boundaries between men'?
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ A1: It goes back to 'stages of losing this document' section and realising that the topmost 'not-losing-this-document' is 'maintaining existing ELO rating' in some xyz-area, and not the 'IFS' because you can be as good as some other man in some area of expertise, or else you're lost. Some expert on making money (e.g. some 'serial startup CEO' he's an expert in making money, and if you work as a librarian, then probably you should then focus on 'ELO rating' && 'making money' to compare yourself to a 'top expert' in that field, and hence know from there ... where do you 'dig' next...) ... but if you're not focusing on 'elo-rating' at all then you could end up working as a librarian which kind-of sub-par (if you're even given a free time by the govt, etc.) ...
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ A2.1: Don't know how it's related to the question, but one important property of chess is that an experienced player, can win over a newbie, 5 times in a row with a very high probability. In domino, it's not so.

[>] One idea (probably might not work): Ask the AI to either guide you how to build your own ai step-by-step or to build your own blockchain from scratch 'step-by-step' ...
[@ ^ 1.] It's important to remember to publish ChatGPT output unless it's tangentially related to chess (as Jay Wacker does (his twitter is full of 'interesting chess positions' wtf) ...

[##] Preamble (breaking into 'unbreakable' steps):

[###] Step: Backtracking to '_airdrops_ pomodoro time tracking' (if any ...)

[###] Step: Dtao - after 'airdrops pomodoro tracking' 

[>] ^^ Dtao is another tool is another tool, besides one-cent-a-year-narrative that helps against gaslighting ... now is there ever a gaslighting present? ==> You'll never know ... whether there is one or not ... 
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ The problem with dtao is that it has a 'limits problem' as in ... if you go 'all-in' into dtao -- then it can grow into being 1-2-3-...-10 pages long ... and it is overwhelming and 'burnout' to write it every day like that (or, you need a some sort of 'medical clown' ... to deal with such sort of extreme mundanity) ... and it's hard even by convincing yourself that one person in prison just had to get by just by reading a f*cking dictionary to pass time .. still the brain 'does not believe' ...
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ Immigration to ramat aviv (to a more like 'vacation'/'resort' vibe zone) was a matter of luck purely and entirely. Там ты можешь сидеть как в тюрьме и читать словарь и быть пофеньке ... а в других с забитостью населения местах ... в 500 раз тяжелее сидеть как в тюрьме и 'читать словарь' ... мозг всеравно 'не хочет верить' в то что какой-то чувак проводил время в тюрьме читая словарь -- а может он наврал все-таки для типа чтобы заработать для своей статьи лайки и деньги итп?

[#] Breaking down testnets ideal daily routine (for the 'ideal' case) 

[##] Preamble 1 
[>] First of all, 100$ should be 'covered' by 'mining' alone, and testnets are definitely a some sort of 'knee-jerk' reaction to 'overwhelm' or an 'impossibilty' (some sort of 'stress-soothing' routine)

[>] Most likely, getting outside (unless it's heavy rain and all my pairs of jeans and socks and sneakers are already wet from yesterday's rain, etc.) to some sort of 'minimally-decent semi-immersive' place, is the least bad option ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Shifting focus onto chess && 'chess-related-programming'? (e.g. xiangqi & shogi engines, guis,) ... 
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ Chess is important when falling, because hopefully with some last-ditch self-poisoning effort - you'll fall onto nadine-lucas-lookalike support group, and then, if you say 'wrong thing' in their chat (due to 'why does he never talk?/Is he spying on us?!?!' aura) -- then you'll be sitting 5 hours in-the-bushes without understanding why, unable to move (in other words' - do not give 'too many chess pieces' in-the-chat (say 'minimum' (something 'minimal'-but-'coherent')).

[>] ^^ NFT's and Dall-E -- definitely shit of the shits because definitely even though it doesn't have a 'shitposting' component to it ... is still super-shitty because you'll never find any sort of seller/buyer for ages for your 1000's generated nft's so then what?

[>] ^^ Bachini's simplistic trading bot && ChatGPT -- this could be useful, but obviously not for 'full-time work' as even he himself said, that, above 300$ you get capped but if it could net me 1000$ a year that could definitely replace airdrops hunting and not get 'seduced' onto that sphere/realm! ==> This could 'conflict' with my 'leverage trading simulation' app so more 'digesting' is required (or I'm just not destined to ...)

[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Via micro-steps, right? No rush, right?

[>] Second top should be most probably tetris-attack (not the 6x12 but also maybe 12x24 or 12x48) ...

Ideas that don't fit distress coding narrative, but something I wished at some time for my homebrew:
[>] ^^ On Ctrl-Alt-I script -- save 'sets' of searches (e.g. I found both 'evolution of desire' on top panel, and also 'evolitsiya seksualnogo vlecheniya' on the bottom panel) ... and I know that I have this possibility on Ctrl-Alt-P, but, ... I still am sometimes residing in 'pissed off' states, so I want to also have that save option in Ctrl-Alt-I too ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ So how would it work? Wouldn't it 'clutter'? Should It open another pop-up? Should there be a third panel? On the right? On The Bottom? Should there be a button to hide/show right panel?
