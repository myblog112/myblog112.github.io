Hopefully, this is 'top-level enough' (above hackmd.io, cryptpad, discord, etc.) ... so I'll be able to 'trackback' [<script name="'trackback'">makeQuizElem2('J3RyYWNrYmFjayc=','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] to it all the time ...
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ This is definitely a [<script name="problem">makeQuizElem2('cHJvYmxlbQ==','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>], that is 'shameful' to admit existence of it ... but again, 'fingers in elecric socket' reflex polarisation ...
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ Again, the problem being, that unless I got some ~ 100-200$ usd in crypto -- this document merely becomes a mere 'another document in filesystem' and I have this 'lost in filesystem' syndrome ...
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ You can blame synchronious knockos on this, but it also sometimes feels like this is even above knockos ... e.g. think municipality (city municipality) and/or government level problem ... like. if you 'remove' knockos, somebody else will 99% come in their place 
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Though again some of the information is more private and is currently in 'agenda' doc/excel' ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ I don't want to split that private 'agenda' doc to 'meta' and 'agenda' ... just attach prices to notes there ... 

[#] Unfortunately, some preamble notes that shouldn't be here (but out of helplessness they are here) (...)

[>] Try to obfuscate longhand paper terms (before a period came (and such will come)) when you need longhand paper like air. And can't because the 'obfuscation problem' ... 
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ And also try to obfuscate this website too (because they _will_ find it however you want think differently) (doesn't hurt to be 'too paranoid' in this case).

[>] 'Bonding leverage' && 'Banano burn' ... (if voices just keep 'bleeding out of me' and 'can't stop that kind of bleeding' ... (?))
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ You understand that twitter.com conflicts with <a id="obfz008">'r/nosurf'</a><script>makeQuizElem('obfz008','J3Ivbm9zdXJmJw==','please obfuscate me!');</script> and inputs into your head an enormous amount of useless noise ... is it worth 1000$/year?
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ Unless there's an extreme instance of 'virulent cautistic critic' (and there will sooner or later yes will be (you got nowhere to go ...) ...) .. or some other psyche extremity - do not f*cking mess with f*cking twitter.com and other dopamine sites.
[>>> 1.1.1.1.] ^^ Caveat emptor - there might be problems with this during 'resting day' such as 'inner conflict' ... (but again this is a good grounding method nevertheless ...) (when nothing to hang onto ...)

[>] 'Bonding leverage' && 'Ramat Aviv' Self ... bonding leverage sometimes is 'appliable' ... sometimes not ... when it's 'appliable' ... then first and foremost it should be for meeting your 'Ramat Aviv' Self ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ 'Immigration precisely to ramat aviv was a matter of [<script name="luck">makeQuizElem2('bHVjaw==','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>]' ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ Они мне делают 'неспокойно' каждые 5 минут ... Я не знаю кто они ... что они итп итп итп ...

[>] Some other useful activities to 'pair' 'Bonding Leverage' with (when it's 'pairable' ..) ==> 'Schnitzel', 'Redpill/MRA Content', 'Tetris Attack', 'Mom/Civ', 'Piano', 'Guitar', 'FLS',, (tbd1),,
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ 'P[<script name="plagiarism (sw)">makeQuizElem2('bGFnaWFyaXM=','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>]m',,

[>>> 1.1.] ^^ 'Contacting Nadine Lucas and/or IFS therapist'

[>] Когда куришь табак то тогда мечтай об [<script name="маленьких беленьких червячках которые будут глодать твои кости">makeQuizElem2('0LzQsNC70LXQvdGM0LrQuNGFINCx0LXQu9C10L3RjNC60LjRhSDRh9C10YDQstGP0YfQutCw0YUg0LrQvtGC0L7RgNGL0LUg0LHRg9C00YPRgiDQs9C70L7QtNCw0YLRjCDRgtCy0L7QuCDQutC+0YHRgtC4','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] под землей ('fingers in electric socket' polarization) ... (which is 'truism' ...) ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Однако фокусироваться на [<script name="червячках">makeQuizElem2('0YfQtdGA0LLRj9GH0LrQsNGF','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] под землей просто так, посередине бела дня -- это может быть немножко [<script name="идиотизм">makeQuizElem2('0LjQtNC40L7RgtC40LfQvA==','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] шо тогда 'эффект' пропадает может быть х/з ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ Alternatively, 'Tremble' for [<script name="'fingers in the socket' reflex polarisation">makeQuizElem2('J2ZpbmdlcnMgaW4gdGhlIHNvY2tldCcgcmVmbGV4IHBvbGFyaXNhdGlvbg==', '&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] (with such polarisation's existence - tobacco consumption that is proven by statistical research to be very harmful shouldn't make sense (?)))

[>] Почему на соседей лучше стараться из-за всех сил не обращать внимания даже если доебываюцца? ==> (и почему вообще нужно писать это сюда в этот список/сайт?) ==> Потому что они например ну как путин все типа вокруг знают что он газлайтит типа фейки там итп иноагенты все там итп ... но в конце концов это 'война газлайтов' в которой они всеравно выиграют типа говоря что 'ахх, мы всего лишь двигали кресла и пылесосили пол и иногда стул слишком сильно стукался об пол ... и мы не знаем че с ним с этим случилось -- нервный какой-то н*хх может его забрать в больницу надо 'проверить' а то типа нервный какой-то начинает кричать как бешенный мы боимся за своих детей (и особенно женского пола) может он им сделает там что нибудь -- терроризирует он весь район -- все мы боимся что он там следующее вытворит с его криками бешенства постоянными -- трясемся уже!) ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Immigration precisely to ramat aviv was a matter of 'luck' (?)
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ Удержать свою связь с 'рамат авивским' ['immigration precisely to ramat aviv was a matter of luck' - 'Я'] пока находишься в этом микрорайоне (там тоже такое есть но гораздо меньше ощутимо потому что поток русских и иностранных туристов и смешиваешься с ними и не 'singled out' 'waaaaay too obviously' (они ненавидят белых ашкеназов и даже на мусорных ящиках это пишут!! Рядом с бензоколонкой на ул. гиссин ... или х/з какая другая причина ... гомогенная среда которая ненавидит 'чужаков' они все с друг другом на балкончиках сидят и это часть их 'тайтли-книт коммьюнити'/'tightly-knit community' (?)).

[>] Relation of 'crypto bonding leverage' to 'ifs' and 'dangeli' ... ==> is that if you ever talk about ifs anywhere then you're a 'guru' and then you'll have to overpay SteveP 10,000$ ... and in case of 'IFS' will probably not 'overpay to an ifs therapist' but rather ban from an 'ifs therapist' because he will consider you 'too diffucult' a patient and 'will part with you' 'gently' (everything is for sale) ... 
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ And to bond 'talking/not talking' about ifs with thousands of $$$$ ...

[>] The relation between katrain and crypto? ==> Crypto is needed to shut up and not talk on ifs forums because of parallel between 'Pay SteveP 10000$' phenomenon and 'IFS Therapists Landscape Ban' (which would parallely happen if you 'tell everybody how great IFS is' just like as it would with if you told everybody (['sad'] wink,wink ;) !!) how great 'Stephane' is which would lead you to 'The Guru' aka SteveP and it would not be 'cheap' ...)
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ And with crypto the whole 'airdrop farming' shebang is extremely 'noisy' and 'non-linear' and has 'resting day' 'inner conflict' (is it money or not?) aka though it is helpful in extreme states of psyche -- it 'wants' to be 'minimised' and yet it's 'very difficult' to be minimised (probably to 'bitcoin' and 'rvn mining card') and no 'internet' involvement whatsoever ... ==> And chess/go/baduk is also there as a 'tool' to 'shut up' about the same 'stephane' and 'stevep' and 'ifs' ... as in 'don't give out chess pieces' or give a 'minimal possible' chess pieces to be able to survive the later onset of SteveP overwhelm.

[>] What's the relation of 'mom'/'civ' and crypto? ==> Basically the same as the relation between katrain and crypto (see above), but, sometimes, when you feel when you are going to fly to 'Melahim Be-Rotschild' -- playing 'Mom'/'Civ'/'Ufo-Ea' can help you with confidence that you can still study chess/go to a decent level, without needing external help. 

[>] What's the relation between 'tetris attack' and 'crypto'? ==> Basically as with katrain and crypto - there are 2 problems: (1) Crypto is used to 'bond' against talking about IFS which is disasterous to the extent of 'banned by all ifs therapists' yet the 'sleep doctor didn't yet reach his final verdict' (see more detailed explanation in some other doc (this one is a public doc)). (2) Crypto in itself has problems, such as: (2.1.) A conflict with nosurf (aka fills my head with unneccessant twitter noise all the time when I want is a quiet trauma processing with a fiction book). (2.2.) 'Resting day' 'inner conflict' ... (3) (tbd1,,)
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ And when you get banned from all ifs therapists -- obviously the first thing the [inner] critics will say 'what. a. fucking. idiot. have. you. been.' ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ Definition from wikipedia: 'Idiot' was formerly a technical term in legal and psychiatric contexts for some kinds of profound intellectual disability where the mental age is two years or less, and the person cannot guard themself against common physical dangers.
[>>> 1.1.1.1.] ^^ And yet idiots rarely solve puzzles there seems to be an 'inverse' correlation between an 'idiot' aka. 2 year old child who can barely walk ... and someone who is good at solving non-trivial puzzles quickly. ...
[>>> 1.1.1.1.1.] ^^ And somehow, since 'getting banned' from 'ifs therapists landscape' is 'being such an idiot' then maybe playing tetris attack could, sort of, somehow, 'negate' that before that happened (due again to 'inverse correlation' between an idiot and someone who is good at 'solving some non-trivial puzzles for speed') ... by 'spinning' some sort of 'rusty' 'cog' wheel in the head ... that will 'fire' when I'm about to say something 'wrong' to an ifs therapist that I would normally not notice if I woudn't have trained myself to 'solve non-trivial puzzles quickly' at all ... 

[>] Just like there's 'maintaining the same level' of elo with katrain ... there's also maintaing the same level of some sort of 'elo-like rating' with 'tetris attack' ... (e.g. can you solve/spot 10 matches a minute or is it now only being able to spot 1 match only per 10 minutes)? -- so it is kind of a rate-y too ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Also with 'mom'/'civ' there exists elo-like rating (of some sort) (which is not official but you can get a sense when you've 'deteriorated' too much on that 'meta' scale) ...

[>] Definitely reading blockchain [<script name='technologies'>makeQuizElem2('dGVjaG5vbG9naWVz','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] books _all week_ (not just in 'resting day') could help you not drown further into 'ProblemWebSurfing' airdrop farming madness ...

[>] Maybe install & maintain Brown Dust and Langrisser (gather daily diamonds ...) so you'd have something to do at weekend ..
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ After all he even blackmails you with offline games ...

[>] If I'm that strong that people 'sneeze' due to my thoughts, or that smart that I deserve some sort of a nobel prize (or multiple/several nobel prizes), then how come I've not yet got 150 million in bitcoin? (I said that when I got ~ 150 million - then I can airdrop)

[>] Is there '[<script name='untameable/uncontrollable'>makeQuizElem2('dW50YW1lYWJsZS91bmNvbnRyb2xsYWJsZQ==','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] running commentary that just won't stop' lurking there? (?)

[>] Crypto minimalism ==> Ideally, farming should be achieved with a few mining cards. And no involvement with 'web3' whatsoever.

[>] In crypto chats you should 'shut up' even if it might mean that you lose 1000$ ... -- because the whole point (or one major point) of 'bonding leverage' is 
because you lack (lacked) 'self-disciplining' to be able to shut up about other topics such as 'IFS and Stephane and SteveP 10000$ and IFS Therapists Ban' ... and 
if you open yourself up to communication with some possibly angry and 'unreasonable' mod with whom you might be needing to negotiate 'unban' now ... then you 'set 
yourself up' for a 'hole in self disciplining' which you were lacking in the first place and came to 'bonding leverage' just exactly because of that one problem (!!) ...
(re-read this very paragraph from the beginning (maybe a few times (not trying to be 'offending' here))) ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ So the rule of thumb is - to never, ever talk -- even if it loses us 1000-2000$ ...

[>] Don't forget about [<script name='Eckhart Tolle/Hanan Sagiv narrative'>makeQuizElem2('RWNraGFydCBUb2xsZS9IYW5hbiBTYWdpdiBuYXJyYXRpdmU=','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] when you conversing with parents ... or you gonna fall and never find, never find ...

[>] 'Paralyzing Fame Residue'/'Compliments Overwhelm'/'Grandiosity overwhelm' ==> [This is not 100% bulletproof but] ==> Play with { 'still haven't got [<script name='150 million $'>makeQuizElem2('MTUwIG1pbGxpb24gJA==','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] bitcoin if I'm that very smart huh how come' } narrative (and also 'I can airdrop only when I have 150 million $ in bitcoin and I'm short of that sum so far) (?)
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ It works 'better' because basically I could have that sum without anyone on the planet earth knowing (compared to fiat money)...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ 'That was heroism what you did today!' ==> 'But that heroism wasn't enough to get me to [<script name='150 million $'>makeQuizElem2('MTUwIG1pbGxpb24gJA==','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] in bitcoin, wasn't it? (?)' (?) 
[>>> 1.1.1.1.] ^^ That is valid as long as I got [<script name='24h internet connection'>makeQuizElem2('MjRoIGludGVybmV0IGNvbm5lY3Rpb24=','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] & some [<script name='privacy'>makeQuizElem2('cHJpdmFjeQ==','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>].

[>] What's the relation of 'knocking neighbors' to 'redpill/mra' videos? ==> 'Government-backed [<script name='feminism nonsense'>makeQuizElem2('ZmVtaW5pc20gbm9uc2Vuc2U=','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] overwhelm' vs. 'dick existence' polarisation ...

[>] { 'Government-backed feminism nonsense overwhelm' vs. 'dick existence' } polarisation needs to be fed 'context' ... both the 'cults' context (because r/datingoverfifty is super-hellish) ... also the mra context (medusa wives existence && you are not alone/isolated/ostracised by govt. backed feminsim nonsense overwhelm && how they cope with it) ... 
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ And maybe also cptsd/ifs/did/academically-backed trauma context ('fantastic beasts and where to find them') (you know about Jay Wacker).
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ This can definitely [<script name='impede'>makeQuizElem2('aW1wZWRl','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] getting outside as you meet eyes with pumped-up Fatma's you just lose all hyper-focus there ever ever ever was ... and most certainly get 'lost' on the way ('how a 'skirt' can make a man 'trip') ...
[>>> 1.1.1.1.] ^^ This just puts them from 'a walking angel'/'i saw an angel' state into some more 'neutral' 'balanced' light (e.g. such as what I got from r/femaledatingstrategy: 'she's going to check the baldness of her future bf's father' etc.) ... and hopefully give you more 'rite of passage' ...
[>>> 1.1.1.1.1.] ^^ There's also some 'dark' sh*t to process like 'I don't fit into the gaussian' and 'Aurelia Brouwers' (if I try to expand on this here --> it really 'dark' sh*t trust me ...) ...

[>] Please be gentle with yourself in a sense that before I found out about no-bad-parts frame, I have been rebelling against my own parts .. after listening to owen cook in a sense that I've learned that I've been 'projecting my ego' onto other people and now I'm not ... I'm above that filthy, despicable low-life level!
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ In a sense that when a 'saving grace' voice appeared -- I've been f*cking rebelling against it instead of asking it protector questions ... so I've done a bunch of stupid things, many of whom might take beyond lifetime (not enough vitality, etc.) to unburden ...

[>] The narrative/motive of 'copycat studying' of 'bjj & chin-na' (copycat I mean via palpating their's books, not youtubs) -- for the sake of 'limits problem' -- never went away nowhere ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ With bjj alone you're still in 'fog' in a sense that 'how do you get him to the ground'? So you need chin-na copycatting too ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ And one important takeaway from this is it although you've lost ~60-70% of do-kwon's money ... it's still important to somehow manage not losing the last 100$ in crypto or else this very document ... I won't be able to navigate to ... and will be [<script name='[lost in filesystem]'>makeQuizElem2('ZmlsZXN5c3RlbQ==','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] forever again.
[>>> 1.1.1.1.1] ^^ So from that I suppose - we must infer our 'testnets' and 'airdrops' participation ... (this 'promised airdrop' 'instability'/'jitteredness' unfortunately still remains ...) as I'm still stuck in petah tikva endless maze.

[>] ^^ So how about 'stay the same elo-like rating' with 'bjj & chin-na' and don't 'deteriorate'?
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Always, always try to [<script name='backtrack'>makeQuizElem2('YmFja3RyYWNr','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] back to 'maintaining the same elo' with katrain/mom/civ/tetris-attack if/when tolerable/possible because amnesia left-and-right ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ So there's a lot of ifs protector clusterf*ckia involved here ... (tbd1,,)
[>>> 1.1.1.1.] ^^ First thing there's [<script name='amnesia'>makeQuizElem2('YW1uZXNpYQ==','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] (dementia? (?)) episodes when I 'jump' straight onto bjj youtube vids (even under theembodimentconference.org) 

[>] ^^ So, if we're talking about 'maintaining existing elo levels' - then are there 'elo levels' of: Foreign & Spoken languages knowledge? Of Guitar & Piano knowledge/skill? Of Drawing? Of Tai-chi? Of Programming? Rpg story/journey games?
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Drawing - probably not (as there is very little 'competition context') ...
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ We need/want that for 'bjj & chin-na' spindown as seemingly just katrain/mom/civ/tetris-attack just don't seem to 'cut' it on their own alone-wise ...

[>] Basically, the idea of visiting ramat aviv every 72 hours, is because (1) If I delay it for 'too long' then traveling there - even after 48+ hours of staying there nearby (or near) (or adjacent to) the seashore -- I still won't be able to find a difference between prison and freedom (*1) ... and will fall asleep uncontrollably (*2) ... and then I will be forcefully taken! (which is unwanted? (?) (<-- haha! lol! ... --> see (*3),(*4) --> lol! lololololololololol!) 
[@ ^ 1.] (*1) ^^ (similar things happened where I couldn't, bluntly in-your-face watching the sea and standing literally near it at night, snap out of, the thought that 'prison is better than freedom' into 'freedom is better then prison') ==> ... so how come this then couldn't come to 'being unable to dissect even after just f*cking 48+ hours staying there' (if I delayed 'myself' in petah-tikva for 'too long'?)) ???
[@ ^ 2.] (*2) (like also happened in yaar bon (I just said f*ck it - I'm laying down wtf ja! ja! - aaand so I did ... and woke up at ~ 7 pm (luckily no one noticed a near-homeless person lying on the ground ...))
[@ ^ 3.] (*3) (and then though, it might require some bueracracy to get out they might 'test' me there for half a year ... one thing is when I myself get 'напасти' and going and trying to snap out ... the other thing entirely is when other people are directly involved and are 'supervising' my 'snapping out' process,) ... (tbd1,,)
[@ ^ 4.] (*4) also I just 'vaguely' remember that no matter what you think _now_ under mild tobacco influence & possibly some other lsd-like toxins that they 'secretly' 'shoved' there,, but after you resided in the same room with 4 foreign people the 'serial humiliation' dynamic (like in handesaim with 'roi') slowly started to 'sneak in' and you wanted out of there like 'off the hot stove' ... so again ... it might be possible that some lsd-like substances in Pall Mall Blue are doing that to me (this 'unable to discern between 'prison' and 'freedom' states) ...
[>>> 
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Need a functioning alarm clock in the f*cking house!

[>] Tai-chi && 'Bonding Leverage' // Tai-chi & 'Bonding Leverage' ==> ?

[>] 'Limits problem' (this is important for some reason? (?)) came from talking about martial arts on IFS discord server ... (tbd1,,)
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ 'Limits problem' helps accumulate 'self energy' when there is none (but 'trembling' for 'limits problem' is 'exhausting' ...) (so maybe I didn't solve here no sh*t ...) ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ Try trembling for 'limits problem' and 'tai-chi' might be survivable might be not (at home) (ha!)
[>>> 1.1.1.1.] ^^ If things go 'super mental' -- try 'backtracking' by 'rubbing shoulders' with 'crypto doc' (aka. this very document ...) (ha!)

[>] Relation between 'tai-chi' and 'crypto'? ==> Больной факт он, что если у меня нету [<script name='8-9k$'>makeQuizElem2('OC05ayQ=','&lt;pomflh&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] как однажды было ... то тогда всеравно остается тай-чи (или должен оставаться по крайней мере ... или Я опять между стульев.

(?))

[>] MRA стабилизирует твою психику тем, что ты получаешь group strengthening - что ты не совсем один эмидст фемнизм легал 'feminism's government-backed nonsense' overwhelm.

[>] [SW_VS_FARMING_1] Last but not least: If you could 'fix bugs' or 'write code' instead of 'airdrop farming' this would be 1000x better due to the simple reason that the 'intelligence bar' to 'airdrop farming' is very, very low and hence it's more of a 'waste of time' than coding anything useful for yourself would be ...

'Drown' and 'never find', 'never find', 'never find' ...

[>] Отношения с бумагой и ручкой - и секьюрити -- они всеравно полны внутренних конфлкиктов т.е. -- как мне 'упаковывать' бумагу? Как мне 'прятать туда' бумагу ... Как мне 'избавляться' от бумаги котрую Я не хочу чтобы люди читали? Что если меня 'вынесло' на улицу 'покурить' а Я в забытии оставил полу-написанную бумагу на столе доступную всем для чтения? (?) -- иногда с таким критиком 'справляться' -- всеравно очень хочется чтобы была хотя-бы 'приемлемая' возможность писать ноххой вещи на бумаге, и быть 'спокойным' с этим ... 
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Достаточно ли мне того что dw1 подсказал? (?)

[>] Насчет бумаги -- всеравно сидел вот на диване и чувствовал что Я не 'вмещаюсь' в бумагу то есть типа если ты хочешь принять 'least bad option' или 'least bad trajectory' - style descision -- то всеравно бумага не доведет тебя до этого ... больше что-то в стиле 'шахматы' и 'ифс' и так же может быть потому что шахматы тебя могут 'выпульнуть' в мелахим бе-ротшильд -- типа так-же добавлять всевозможные другие 'тормозители' 'языко-соскальзываний' ... в плане может мом или тетрис аттак или всякие другие оффлайновские, но компьютерные (к сожалению не только 'бумага-и-ручка') активности ...

[>] Насчет соседей -- типа ты не знаешь что ты в состоянии 'beyond self-disciplining' или нет ... потому что (1) 'эмбодимент' зависит от визитирования такого-или-иного -- норзерн квартерса ('immigration precisely to ramat-aviv was a matter of luck') ... (х/з может потому что там все-еще возможна работа близкая к программированию (каким-то е*нным макаром х/з хотя может и эмбодимент там тоже скоро 'исчезнет' мы не можем этого знать ...) ... и (2) ты не знаешь -- когда (если вообще) ты сможешь в следующий раз туда приехать/доехать (вот так вот ...) (как насчет приубраться в квартире за 2-3 часа, а?) ... и (3) если ты потенциально в состоянии 'beyond self-disciplining' -- то это значит что злость на соседей может в любой момент 'перескользнуть' в 'вопль' -- и тогда они тебя будут 'иметь' ('вот тут такой-то какой-то странный живет! Мы уже боимся! Что он сделает с нашими детьми! Особенно женского рода!' итп.) что мы тоже хотим избежать ... поэтому больше чем 'шепотом' проклинать соседей - это уже 'красный флаг' т.е. если 'выскользнуло' что то 'вслух' про соседей - то это уже гр*мадный п*здец.

[@ ^ 3.] ^^ Do not fret. It should be 2-3 major airdrops a year. No more.

[>] Extremely Poisonous Step 4: Address existing L1 & L2 testnets (continuity) (micro-steps) 

[@ ^ 1.] ^^ L1 & L2 - come first before protocols (2-3 'major' airdrops a year on the whole of the internets). 
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ Do swaps until 'enough enough enough' ... e.g. sometimes 2 swaps are not enough ... 3 -- maybe enough maybe not ... (depending on a project, etc.) ... 3-10 transactions & swaps preferably spread 3-4 Weeks (Optimism wanted 3-4 weaks spread, Paraswap v2 - now wants 6 swaps).
[@ ^ 3.] ^^ Find their bulletin boadrs & forums if possible (discords are 'overwhelm' forums less so) ... from there you can see 'governance' etc.  1 Governance vote is rewarded (Optimism) ...
[@ ^ 4.] ^^ Tracking in a document is 'grounding'! ==> Track which account and how many swaps you made on that account and whether you voted on their governance at least 1 time.
