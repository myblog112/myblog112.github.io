Hopefully, this is 'top-level enough' (above hackmd.io, cryptpad, discord, etc.) ... so I'll be able to 'trackback' [<script name="'trackback'">makeQuizElem2('J3RyYWNrYmFjayc=','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] to it all the time ...
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ This is definitely a [<script name="problem">makeQuizElem2('cHJvYmxlbQ==','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>], that is 'shameful' to admit existence of it ... but again, 'fingers in elecric socket' reflex polarisation ...
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ Again, the problem being, that unless I got some ~ 100-200$ usd in crypto -- this document merely becomes a mere 'another document in filesystem' and I have this 'lost in filesystem' syndrome ...
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ You can blame synchronious knockos on this, but it also sometimes feels like this is even above knockos ... e.g. think municipality (city municipality) and/or government level problem ... like. if you 'remove' knockos, somebody else will 99% come in their place 
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Though again some of the information is more private and is currently in 'agenda' doc/excel' ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ I don't want to split that private 'agenda' doc to 'meta' and 'agenda' ... just attach prices to notes there ... 

[#] Unfortunately, some preamble notes that shouldn't be here (but out of helplessness they are here) (...)

[>] Rootedness (aka 'rememberance') of this document is related to existence of 32-bit minecraft and at least 100$ in bitcoin (or most TVL POW (non-coropration) coin) ... that's my current take on it ... e.g. 'the more complex the code - the more vulnerable the money' ... (and also 'the less human factor' -- the more safer the money) ... and so ... before airdrops -- do I have at least 100$ in bitcoin so that this document keeps being remembered?
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ See in tasks below ...

[>] Try to obfuscate longhand paper terms (before a period came (and such will come)) when you need longhand paper like air. And can't because the 'obfuscation problem' ... 
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ And also try to obfuscate this website too (because they _will_ find it however you want think differently) (doesn't hurt to be 'too paranoid' in this case).

[>] 'Bonding leverage' && 'Banano burn' ... (if voices just keep 'bleeding out of me' and 'can't stop that kind of bleeding' ... (?))
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ You understand that twitter.com conflicts with <a id="obfz008">'r/nosurf'</a><script>makeQuizElem('obfz008','J3Ivbm9zdXJmJw==','please obfuscate me!');</script> and inputs into your head an enormous amount of useless noise ... is it worth 1000$/year?
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ Unless there's an extreme instance of 'virulent cautistic critic' (and there will sooner or later yes will be (you got nowhere to go ...) ...) .. or some other psyche extremity - do not f*cking mess with f*cking twitter.com and other dopamine sites.
[>>> 1.1.1.1.] ^^ Caveat emptor - there might be problems with this during 'resting day' such as 'inner conflict' ... (but again this is a good grounding method nevertheless ...) (when nothing to hang onto ...)

[>] 'Bonding leverage' && 'Ramat Aviv' Self ... bonding leverage sometimes is 'appliable' ... sometimes not ... when it's 'appliable' ... then first and foremost it should be for meeting your 'Ramat Aviv' Self ...

[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ Они мне делают 'неспокойно' каждые 5 минут ... Я не знаю кто они ... что они итп итп итп ...

[>] Some other useful activities to 'pair' 'Bonding Leverage' with (when it's 'pairable' ..) ==> 'Schnitzel', 'Redpill/MRA Content', 'Tetris Attack', 'Mom/Civ', 'Piano', 'Guitar', 'FLS',, (tbd1),,
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ 'P[<script name="plagiarism (sw)">makeQuizElem2('bGFnaWFyaXM=','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>]m',,

(which is 'truism' ...) ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Однако фокусироваться на [<script name="червячках">makeQuizElem2('0YfQtdGA0LLRj9GH0LrQsNGF','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] под землей просто так, посередине бела дня -- это может быть немножко [<script name="идиотизм">makeQuizElem2('0LjQtNC40L7RgtC40LfQvA==','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] шо тогда 'эффект' пропадает может быть х/з ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ Alternatively, 'Tremble' for [<script name="'fingers in the socket' reflex polarisation">makeQuizElem2('J2ZpbmdlcnMgaW4gdGhlIHNvY2tldCcgcmVmbGV4IHBvbGFyaXNhdGlvbg==', '&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] (with such polarisation's existence - tobacco consumption that is proven by statistical research to be very harmful shouldn't make sense (?)))

[>] Почему на соседей лучше стараться из-за всех сил не обращать внимания даже если доебываюцца? ==> (и почему вообще нужно писать это сюда в этот список/сайт?) ==> Потому что они например ну как путин все типа вокруг знают что он газлайтит типа фейки там итп иноагенты все там итп ... но в конце концов это 'война газлайтов' в которой они всеравно выиграют типа говоря что 'ахх, мы всего лишь двигали кресла и пылесосили пол и иногда стул слишком сильно стукался об пол ... и мы не знаем че с ним с этим случилось -- нервный какой-то н*хх может его забрать в больницу надо 'проверить' а то типа нервный какой-то начинает кричать как бешенный мы боимся за своих детей (и особенно женского пола) может он им сделает там что нибудь -- терроризирует он весь район -- все мы боимся что он там следующее вытворит с его криками бешенства постоянными -- трясемся уже!) ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Immigration precisely to ramat aviv was a matter of 'luck' (?)
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ Удержать свою связь с 'рамат авивским' ['immigration precisely to ramat aviv was a matter of luck' - 'Я'] пока находишься в этом микрорайоне (там тоже такое есть но гораздо меньше ощутимо потому что поток русских и иностранных туристов и смешиваешься с ними и не 'singled out' 'waaaaay too obviously' (они ненавидят белых ашкеназов и даже на мусорных ящиках это пишут!! Рядом с бензоколонкой на ул. гиссин ... или х/з какая другая причина ... гомогенная среда которая ненавидит 'чужаков' они все с друг другом на балкончиках сидят и это часть их 'тайтли-книт коммьюнити'/'tightly-knit community' (?)).

[>] Relation of 'crypto bonding leverage' to 'ifs' and 'dangeli' ... ==> is that if you ever talk about ifs anywhere then you're a 'guru' and then you'll have to overpay SteveP 10,000$ ... and in case of 'IFS' will probably not 'overpay to an ifs therapist' but rather ban from an 'ifs therapist' because he will consider you 'too diffucult' a patient and 'will part with you' 'gently' (everything is for sale) ... 
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ And to bond 'talking/not talking' about ifs with thousands of $$$$ ...

[>] The relation between katrain and crypto? ==> Crypto is needed to shut up and not talk on ifs forums because of parallel between 'Pay SteveP 10000$' phenomenon and 'IFS Therapists Landscape Ban' (which would parallely happen if you 'tell everybody how great IFS is' just like as it would with if you told everybody (['sad'] wink,wink ;) !!) how great 'Stephane' is which would lead you to 'The Guru' aka SteveP and it would not be 'cheap' ...)
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ And with crypto the whole 'airdrop farming' shebang is extremely 'noisy' and 'non-linear' and has 'resting day' 'inner conflict' (is it money or not?) aka though it is helpful in extreme states of psyche -- it 'wants' to be 'minimised' and yet it's 'very difficult' to be minimised (probably to 'bitcoin' and 'rvn mining card') and no 'internet' involvement whatsoever ... ==> And chess/go/baduk is also there as a 'tool' to 'shut up' about the same 'stephane' and 'stevep' and 'ifs' ... as in 'don't give out chess pieces' or give a 'minimal possible' chess pieces to be able to survive the later onset of SteveP overwhelm.

[>] What's the relation of 'mom'/'civ' and crypto? ==> Basically the same as the relation between katrain and crypto (see above), but, sometimes, when you feel when you are going to fly to 'Melahim Be-Rotschild' -- playing 'Mom'/'Civ'/'Ufo-Ea' can help you with confidence that you can still study chess/go to a decent level, without needing external help. 

[>] What's the relation between 'tetris attack' and 'crypto'? ==> Basically as with katrain and crypto - there are 2 problems: (1) Crypto is used to 'bond' against talking about IFS which is disasterous to the extent of 'banned by all ifs therapists' yet the 'sleep doctor didn't yet reach his final verdict' (see more detailed explanation in some other doc (this one is a public doc)). (2) Crypto in itself has problems, such as: (2.1.) A conflict with nosurf (aka fills my head with unneccessant twitter noise all the time when I want is a quiet trauma processing with a fiction book). (2.2.) 'Resting day' 'inner conflict' ... (3) (tbd1,,)
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ And when you get banned from all ifs therapists -- obviously the first thing the [inner] critics will say 'what. a. fucking. idiot. have. you. been.' ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ Definition from wikipedia: 'Idiot' was formerly a technical term in legal and psychiatric contexts for some kinds of profound intellectual disability where the mental age is two years or less, and the person cannot guard themself against common physical dangers.
[>>> 1.1.1.1.] ^^ And yet idiots rarely solve puzzles there seems to be an 'inverse' correlation between an 'idiot' aka. 2 year old child who can barely walk ... and someone who is good at solving non-trivial puzzles quickly. ...
[>>> 1.1.1.1.1.] ^^ And somehow, since 'getting banned' from 'ifs therapists landscape' is 'being such an idiot' then maybe playing tetris attack could, sort of, somehow, 'negate' that before that happened (due again to 'inverse correlation' between an idiot and someone who is good at 'solving some non-trivial puzzles for speed') ... by 'spinning' some sort of 'rusty' 'cog' wheel in the head ... that will 'fire' when I'm about to say something 'wrong' to an ifs therapist that I would normally not notice if I woudn't have trained myself to 'solve non-trivial puzzles quickly' at all ... 

[>] Just like there's 'maintaining the same level' of elo with katrain ... there's also maintaing the same level of some sort of 'elo-like rating' with 'tetris attack' ... (e.g. can you solve/spot 10 matches a minute or is it now only being able to spot 1 match only per 10 minutes)? -- so it is kind of a rate-y too ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Also with 'mom'/'civ' there exists elo-like rating (of some sort) (which is not official but you can get a sense when you've 'deteriorated' too much on that 'meta' scale) ...

[>] Definitely reading blockchain [<script name='technologies'>makeQuizElem2('dGVjaG5vbG9naWVz','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] books _all week_ (not just in 'resting day') could help you not drown further into 'ProblemWebSurfing' airdrop farming madness ...

[>] Maybe install & maintain Brown Dust and Langrisser (gather daily diamonds ...) so you'd have something to do at weekend ..
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ After all he even blackmails you with offline games ...

[>] If I'm that strong that people 'sneeze' due to my thoughts, or that smart that I deserve some sort of a nobel prize (or multiple/several nobel prizes), then how come I've not yet got 150 million in bitcoin? (I said that when I got ~ 150 million - then I can airdrop)

[>] Is there '[<script name='untameable/uncontrollable'>makeQuizElem2('dW50YW1lYWJsZS91bmNvbnRyb2xsYWJsZQ==','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] running commentary that just won't stop' lurking there? (?)

[>] Crypto minimalism ==> Ideally, farming should be achieved with a few mining cards. And no involvement with 'web3' whatsoever.

[>] In crypto chats you should 'shut up' even if it might mean that you lose 1000$ ... -- because the whole point (or one major point) of 'bonding leverage' is 
because you lack (lacked) 'self-disciplining' to be able to shut up about other topics such as 'IFS and Stephane and SteveP 10000$ and IFS Therapists Ban' ... and 
if you open yourself up to communication with some possibly angry and 'unreasonable' mod with whom you might be needing to negotiate 'unban' now ... then you 'set 
yourself up' for a 'hole in self disciplining' which you were lacking in the first place and came to 'bonding leverage' just exactly because of that one problem (!!) ...
(re-read this very paragraph from the beginning (maybe a few times (not trying to be 'offending' here))) ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ So the rule of thumb is - to never, ever talk -- even if it loses us 1000-2000$ ...

[>] Don't forget about [<script name='Eckhart Tolle/Hanan Sagiv narrative'>makeQuizElem2('RWNraGFydCBUb2xsZS9IYW5hbiBTYWdpdiBuYXJyYXRpdmU=','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] when you conversing with parents ... or you gonna fall and never find, never find ...

[>] 'Paralyzing Fame Residue'/'Compliments Overwhelm'/'Grandiosity overwhelm' ==> [This is not 100% bulletproof but] ==> Play with { 'still haven't got [<script name='150 million $'>makeQuizElem2('MTUwIG1pbGxpb24gJA==','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] bitcoin if I'm that very smart huh how come' } narrative (and also 'I can airdrop only when I have 150 million $ in bitcoin and I'm short of that sum so far) (?)
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ It works 'better' because basically I could have that sum without anyone on the planet earth knowing (compared to fiat money)...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ 'That was heroism what you did today!' ==> 'But that heroism wasn't enough to get me to [<script name='150 million $'>makeQuizElem2('MTUwIG1pbGxpb24gJA==','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] in bitcoin, wasn't it? (?)' (?) 
[>>> 1.1.1.1.] ^^ That is valid as long as I got [<script name='24h internet connection'>makeQuizElem2('MjRoIGludGVybmV0IGNvbm5lY3Rpb24=','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] & some [<script name='privacy'>makeQuizElem2('cHJpdmFjeQ==','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>].

[>] What's the relation of 'knocking neighbors' to 'redpill/mra' videos? ==> 'Government-backed [<script name='feminism nonsense'>makeQuizElem2('ZmVtaW5pc20gbm9uc2Vuc2U=','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] overwhelm' vs. 'dick existence' polarisation ...

[>] { 'Government-backed feminism nonsense overwhelm' vs. 'dick existence' } polarisation needs to be fed 'context' ... both the 'cults' context (because r/datingoverfifty is super-hellish) ... also the mra context (medusa wives existence && you are not alone/isolated/ostracised by govt. backed feminsim nonsense overwhelm && how they cope with it) ... 
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ And maybe also cptsd/ifs/did/academically-backed trauma context ('fantastic beasts and where to find them') (you know about Jay Wacker).
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ This can definitely [<script name='impede'>makeQuizElem2('aW1wZWRl','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] getting outside as you meet eyes with pumped-up Fatma's you just lose all hyper-focus there ever ever ever was ... and most certainly get 'lost' on the way ('how a 'skirt' can make a man 'trip') ...
[>>> 1.1.1.1.] ^^ This just puts them from 'a walking angel'/'i saw an angel' state into some more 'neutral' 'balanced' light (e.g. such as what I got from r/femaledatingstrategy: 'she's going to check the baldness of her future bf's father' etc.) ... and hopefully give you more 'rite of passage' ...
[>>> 1.1.1.1.1.] ^^ There's also some 'dark' sh*t to process like 'I don't fit into the gaussian' and 'Aurelia Brouwers' (if I try to expand on this here --> it really 'dark' sh*t trust me ...) ...

[>] Please be gentle with yourself in a sense that before I found out about no-bad-parts frame, I have been rebelling against my own parts .. after listening to owen cook in a sense that I've learned that I've been 'projecting my ego' onto other people and now I'm not ... I'm above that filthy, despicable low-life level!
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ In a sense that when a 'saving grace' voice appeared -- I've been f*cking rebelling against it instead of asking it protector questions ... so I've done a bunch of stupid things, many of whom might take beyond lifetime (not enough vitality, etc.) to unburden ...

[>] The narrative/motive of 'copycat studying' of 'bjj & chin-na' (copycat I mean via palpating their's books, not youtubs) -- for the sake of 'limits problem' -- never went away nowhere ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ With bjj alone you're still in 'fog' in a sense that 'how do you get him to the ground'? So you need chin-na copycatting too ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ And one important takeaway from this is it although you've lost ~60-70% of do-kwon's money ... it's still important to somehow manage not losing the last 100$ in crypto or else this very document ... I won't be able to navigate to ... and will be [<script name='[lost in filesystem]'>makeQuizElem2('ZmlsZXN5c3RlbQ==','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] forever again.
[>>> 1.1.1.1.1] ^^ So from that I suppose - we must infer our 'testnets' and 'airdrops' participation ... (this 'promised airdrop' 'instability'/'jitteredness' unfortunately still remains ...) as I'm still stuck in petah tikva endless maze.

[>] ^^ So how about 'stay the same elo-like rating' with 'bjj & chin-na' and don't 'deteriorate'?
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Always, always try to [<script name='backtrack'>makeQuizElem2('YmFja3RyYWNr','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] back to 'maintaining the same elo' with katrain/mom/civ/tetris-attack if/when tolerable/possible because amnesia left-and-right ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ So there's a lot of ifs protector clusterf*ckia involved here ... (tbd1,,)
[>>> 1.1.1.1.] ^^ First thing there's [<script name='amnesia'>makeQuizElem2('YW1uZXNpYQ==','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] (dementia? (?)) episodes when I 'jump' straight onto bjj youtube vids (even under theembodimentconference.org) 

[>] ^^ So, if we're talking about 'maintaining existing elo levels' - then are there 'elo levels' of: Foreign & Spoken languages knowledge? Of Guitar & Piano knowledge/skill? Of Drawing? Of Tai-chi? Of Programming? Rpg story/journey games? ==> Moved to separate section ...
``` TODELETE
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ If something goes wrong (it did happen once - with 'ifs elo') -- go back / retract to 'maintaining the same elo level with katrain' - it still works ...
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Drawing - probably not (as there is very little 'competition context') ...
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ We need/want that for 'bjj & chin-na' spindown as seemingly just katrain/mom/civ/tetris-attack just don't seem to 'cut' it on their own alone-wise ...
[@ ^ 3.] ^^ It seems that tai-chi (aka. 'martial arts meditation' (as opposed to yoga, which is a 'postures' meditation)) is a 'part of' maintaining same elo level with 'bjj&chin-na'? E.g. 'do at least some 'farthest resemblance' movement? (?) (?) (?)
[@ ^ 3.1.] ^^ Or maybe I'm wrong? (?) (?) (?)
[@ ^ 3.1.1.] ^^ There's no 'maintaining the same elo level with tai-chi kata' because tai-chi is the actually one from which the whole idea of 'keeping _at least_ the same elo level with katrain' hyper-focus came from ... in a sense that it says ... 'at least don't lose martial arts at all if you have bjj painful fracture ... because martial arts are _so_, _so_ important' and 'probably self-rehearsed 'mostly theoretical only' chin-na is better than no chin-na knowledge altogether, even theoretical' from that 'at least don't lose martial arts entirely' probably came the understanding: 'don't lose katrain entirely' ... ==> so supposedly copy-catting chin-na as per jwing ming's books & dvd's (you have both, also for martial applications of it) supposed to 'keep' that 'elo' 'hyper-focus' ==> So I suppose what it should be is: 'copy-catting chin-na and it's martial applications as perfectly as possible' and the best you can make of it ==> Try 'trembling' for it ... who knows ... ==> tbd1,,
[@ ^ 4.] ^^ Is there 'maintaining the same ELO' with ifs? ==> Seems like not so it means that ifs is a 'bottomless pit' yet in some certain situational overwhelm situations it is very useful... and there are a lot of overwhelming situational situations in certain specific GPS locations ... ==> tbd1,,
[@ ^ 4.1.] ^^ Also: ifs is not a bottomless pit in a sense that if a specific individual is in some cult (or jumping between cults) ... then ifs provides an 'academically-refined' cult which is a 'less' 'bottomless pit' than some other 'cults' that exist out there ... due to 'academia-peer-review' property of it ...,, but still tbd1
[@ ^ 4.1.1.] ^^ So in a sense ifs is not a 'bottomless pit' but rather is a 'lesser' 'bottomless pit' which is good for segments of population who reside in a 'bottomless pit' (e.g. cults followers who do not realise and/or blackout within them, the harmful effects of their cults)...
[@ ^ 6.] ^^ Is there 'elo level' regarding 'digital minimalism' and 'extreme privacy' (a.k.a. michael bezzel? (?)) ==> Apparently can't touch that because moving to ramat aviv is on a 'higher note' than 'worrying about extreme privacy' because if I'm not 'careful' then the whole shebang of being near 'internet' & 'privacy' could be 'taken away' from me ... so it's secondary unfortunately (and things will inevitably 'spill' the painful ones which shouldn't ...)
[@ ^ 6.1.]
[@ ^ 7.] ^^ Just curious - is there 'elo level' with bridge? ==> Well yep if you sit 3h bridge marathon with Oren Lidor and/or Doron Yadlin -- you will either score less or score more or equal -- and that determines your elo level compared to them ... 
[@ ^ 7.1.] ^^ This elo level is rather 'sparse' compared to chess e.g. statistical-rather but in overall sense if you run 10-days marathon against one of them ... then their { (1) Memorisation of bidding language. (2) Knowledge to recognise of signals when playing hand. (3) A little bit of algorighmic thinking of how to play and what not to play depending on what partners played (but this algorithmic thinking is much less 'deep' than chess) (4) ? } ==> will to a large extent determine whether they win or a lose in points in that 10 days marathon. But then again, this is not a 'measure' of anything ... e.g. their algorithmic thinking might be more 'mediocre' than a chess player ... their 'language of bidding' knowledge -- might be due to them having inherited that from their rich parents from childhood ... just like french was a language of 'high circles' in some non-french societies ... but again the purpose of this is mostly about not the 'elo' but rather having some sort of alternate venue of connecting with people / making connections with people ... but then again ... this is not the sole way of making connections ... and it's possible that existence of interconnected internet has made this 'bridge' lucrativity even more obsolete ... as one could simply invest in making an arbitrage bot and blow all the bridge people out of the water ... I mean in a sense that 'bridge' was some sort of 'gamble-pointing of a finger' when you were out of options ... and so you saw e.g. some ad in tel-aviv university sports club and thought: ha! this must be it! ... but it is very possible that for example working with parts and interrogating them with protector questions ... in retrospect ... wouldn't bring you to any 'bridge' seeking altogether. E.g. in a sense of: nothing's broke -- don't apply any sort of 'band-aid' on top of it ... it's like more like carrying some notion of 'if it's all so seemingly 'too calm'' then 'add even more overwhelm on top of it' -- 'and then it all will become clear!' sort of mindset .. which might in retrospect not overwhelm -- the already overwhelmed & mega-traumatised system.
[@ ^ 7.1.1.] ^^ When nobody talks ... there's not to 'bring yourself to people' to cause additional overwhelm on the system, that might in fact, be traumatised and needed more of that ramat aviv immersion ...
[@ ^ 7.1.1.1.] ^^ Probably even 4.30 wouldn't exist and many things wouldn't exist should I have known about 'nonsense lana physicist' much earlier on.
[@ ^ 7.1.1.1.1.] ^^  William Kingdon Clifford: "'It is wrong, always, everywhere and for any one, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence.'"
[@ ^ 8.] ^^ Is there 'cryptocurrency elo rating'? (aka. 'elo rating pertaining to cryptocurrency')
[@ ^ 8.1.] ^^ Blockchain & Crypto Technology books are probably '>' (bigger) in that domain-or-realm, than 'airdrop farming' ... (considering that plain 'indie-crypto lifetime narrative' is 'overwhelm' ...) 
[@ ^ 8.1.1.] ^^ In a sense that 'dry studying' of that technology somehow helps more than just plain farming/sybilling (although counter-intuitive (wtf does studying even help?!?!? (?)))) ...
[@ ^ 8.2.] ^^ Reading a substantial chunk of crypto-technology-or-blockchain-technology [<script name='book'>makeQuizElem2('Ym9vaw==','&lt;pomflh&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] before doing any faucets and/or airdrops? (?) (in a sense of 'which is higher elo level?' - wise)) -- you have staking already ... so ... 
[@ ^ 8.2.1.] ^^ What I'm trying to get to - is to do only minimalist super-obvious airdrop farming ... and like 2-3 precalculated steps (didn't need to jerky-signup for neither ampleforth, nor optimism, nor stargaze, nor evmos, nor aptos, nor paraswap, nor cowswap, etc.) ... jerky-signups definitely f*cks me up. And a 'book' before faucets could get me into an appropriate mood before jumping onto twitter? (?)
[@ ^ 9.] ^^ Is there such a thing as a 'dating elo rating' (as in r/datingoverfifty)? Or lack-of-dating-thereof elo-rating? In a sense that, m, it could be probably related to why ''indie-crypto lifetime narrative' elo rating' is an overwhelm, compared to 'cryptocurrency elo rating' ... ? (?) (?) (?)
[@ ^ 9.1.] ^^ Maybe it's just 'living around women' elo (without involving any sort of 'dating' or 'datingoverfifty' or 'lack-of-dating',, yet ...)
[@ ^ 10.] ^^ Is there ''indie-crypto lifetime narrative' elo rating' (aka. 'elo rating' pertaining to 'indie-crypto narrative') 
[@ ^ 10.1.] ^^ That is seemingly unfortunately is 'overwhelm' of some 'unknown kind' (when you had 8-9k$ - this was not an overwhelm) so unfortunately go back to 'cryptocurency elo rating' and dwell there? (?)

[Try & Maintain existing] 'Katrain elo rating' (when lost & neurotic & cannot find yourself amidst 'floating in pink'/'pink brain'/'preagnant brain' .. ) ==> 'IFS elo rating' ==> 'Cults elo rating' (which is the same as 'ifs elo rating', right?) ==> 'Tai-chi/Martial Arts elo rating' ==> (resting day) ==> 'Bridge elo rating' ==> 'Cryptocurrency elo rating' ==> 'Indie-crypto elo rating' ==> '[Living with potenitally hostile] Women elo rating' ==> (When thinking of '[living with potentially hostile] women elo rating' then it f*cking backtracks to the 'hah, prove yourself!' aka 'the real katrain elo rating maintenance-of' ...

[#] Task: Securing Wallets

==> 0x1a2BF...721f ==> Tbd1,,

[>] ^^ Want: secure storage account that is not even in metamask/keplr most of the [<script name='time'>makeQuizElem2('dGltZQ==','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>]! I accidentally approved something with 'keplr evmos staking wallet' today ... and since sometimes there are problems with staking and I need to use restake.app for it ... then this is by definition not a 'storage' wallet b/c it has to be in metamask and/or keplr all the time. ==> So I want even one more 'storage' acct ...

[>] ^^ Want: 100$ in bitcoin. Do I have them?
[>>>> 1.1.] ^^ It's because rootedness (aka 'rememberance') of this document is related to existence of 32-bit minecraft and at least 100$ in bitcoin (or most TVL POW (non-coropration) coin) ... (and it's 100$ because I yes have 32 bit minecraft otherwise probably ~8-9k would not be enough (?)) ... that's my current take on it ... e.g. 'the more complex the code - the more vulnerable the money' ... (and also 'the less human factor' -- the more safer the money) ... and so ... before airdrops -- do I have at least 100$ in bitcoin so that this document keeps being remembered?
==> ^^ Downloaded bitcoin core wallet - it is really complex (in a sense that might study it's inner cli interface later),, it doesn't even have in it's menu: show private keys / show seed phrase option (I remember it had it in it's command line inner interface) ... ==> So downloaded 'electrum' which is also a bitcoin wallet,, located in: ==> d:\downloads\electrum-4.3.2-portable.exe
==> Want: uninstall bitcoin core for now (from d:\programs\)

[#] Faucets before L1 & L2 (at least one faucet, everything else is 'hypothetical')
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Nosurf is a must (hmm, there's a conflict between 'nosurf' and 'bonding leverage for lipton tea' ...)

[>] Current earnings in clicker: 43 clicks,, $3.80,, 2022.10.25 (checking if it even works) ...

[#] What comes after faucets (extemely poisonous daily routine that comes from 'helplessness' and should be skipped to 'indie homebrew' as soon as humanely possible)

[>] Get to 'homebrew' and 'longhand' as soon as humanely possible: 10 startup ideas on paper, homebrew atomic micro-steps, atomic incremental micro-pilots, 
step-through debugging, extreme-security & extreme-privacy self-work,,

[>] Extremely Poisonous Step 2: Check if airdrop dates where you should claim are approaching and claim on those dates (bonding leverage).

[>] Extremely Poisonous Step 3: Check your current staking ongoings and coingecko (if something got rug-pulled or broken while I was asleep) 

[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Whether restake.app works properly on my staked validators ...
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ Re-ackquantice yourself with status of testnet swaps (from yesterday) ('status check') .. by reading and micro-fixing this doc below. Are wallet swap amt 
statuses in this doc represent real-world situations on respective blockchains?
[@ ^ 3.] ^^ Added 'Want' column under each L2.
[@ ^ 4.] ^^ Micro fixing the status of L1's preparation.

[>] Extremely Poisonous Step 4: Checks and micro-fixing of L1s and Protocols. 

[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Individual twitter checks of 'hot' projects that's about to airdrop soon (e.g. rebus). Not 'binge-twitter'. 
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ Microfixing twitters of projects and wallet stats compared to blockchain real world data.
[@ ^ 3.] ^^ Do not fret. It should be 2-3 major airdrops a year. No more.

[>] Extremely Poisonous Step 4: Address existing L1 & L2 testnets (continuity) (micro-steps) 

[@ ^ 1.] ^^ L1 & L2 - come first before protocols (2-3 'major' airdrops a year on the whole of the internets). 
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ Do swaps until 'enough enough enough' ... e.g. sometimes 2 swaps are not enough ... 3 -- maybe enough maybe not ... (depending on a project, etc.) ... 3-10 transactions & swaps preferably spread 3-4 Weeks (Optimism wanted 3-4 weaks spread, Paraswap v2 - now wants 6 swaps).
[@ ^ 3.] ^^ Find their bulletin boadrs & forums if possible (discords are 'overwhelm' forums less so) ... from there you can see 'governance' etc.  1 Governance vote is rewarded (Optimism) ...
[@ ^ 4.] ^^ Tracking in a document is 'grounding'! ==> Track which account and how many swaps you made on that account and whether you voted on their governance at least 1 time.

[>] Extremely Poisonous Step 5: Scout for new earn/testnet opportunities ...

[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Never talk in discords (see above) ...
[@ ^ 2.] Check discords & telegrams (where the tendencies are) ...
[@ ^ 3.] ^^ Twitter is the worst!
[@ ^ 4.] ^^ You can spend a whole day like that: on twitter, etc.

[>] Extremely Poisonous Step 6: Studying previous airdrops' criteria ... and saving those docs offline ...

[>] Is there an 'uncontrollable/untameable running commentary' that 'just won't stop' lurking there somewhere?

[>] Sometimes the solution to crypto voice overwhelm is not 'intellectual' but rather 'gps-locational'/'spacial' and no matter what crawiling at ceiling at home just won't help. We've been in those and not once.
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Obviously one thing that I'm missing here is that I am 'underestimating'/'downplaying in my mind' the sheer immense difficulty that it sometimes gets/takes to get/to travel to other various gps locations ... although on the first glance this seems so trivial (!!) ... maybe even though it's 'shameful' to admit that now for me to get outside requires 'moving mountains' and 'collossal, immense efforts' on my side ... it's yes worth to try and 'deconstruct' between me and myself ... in such a manner that, m, this would be more straightforward ... and not ''magic' is needed here' kind-of-relation-to-it ...

[@ ^ 3.] 'Daytrading and leverage trading'

[>] [INDIE_CRYPTO_NARRATIVE_1] 'Indie crypto narrative' for 'bonding leverage' for 'lipton tea' is always preferable to 'airdrop farming' for that same leverage ... you have staking coins and beyond that there are 2-3 significant airdrops per year -- jerkiness-hunting for last-minute opportunities is very very hazardous. If they pressure you with time - super hazardous.
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Not being afraid of [missing] some earning opportunities that end in two weeks if you don't 'hurry hurry hurry' ... you have staking coins.

[>] [INDIE_CRYPTO_NARRATIVE_1] Indie-crypto lifetime narrative (micro-steps / incremental-micro-pilots) is better for trauma regulation then 'airdrop beggarship' narrative, because when you're a 'loser' and 'neighbors knock' then 'indie crypto narrative' 'survives' better then 'f*ck it no more airdrops' narrative (in that sense I mean ...) 
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ But again, it's not as 'palpatable' as 'almost-feels-like-real money' which is in 'airdrop hunter' narrative ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ This doc, for one, wouldn't be as 'findable' if not for 'airdrop farming' or '1 cent a year' narrative ...

[>] [COMPLETION_STATUS_COLUMN_1] 2-3 major airdrops per year ... типа когда-то ты понимаешь что по статистике когда ты заработал 1k$-2k$-3k$ то когда тебе раз-в-год прийдет _может быть_ eще 1k$-2k$ (и/или с _большой_ редкостью - 4k$-20k$ -- что нехрена не обещанно и можно так 10 лет прождать и нехера такого больше не будет никогда) то типа понимаешь -- что время которое ты вкладываешь в это - оно становится все более и более бессмысленно и не стоит того - стоит просто сидеть как йог и медитировать -- и психику и так уже досконально до невозможности фрагментированную - не нарушать (хотя-бы этими дерганиями-идиотствами). Вообщем что Я хочу -- чтобы скажем выбрать 'нашумевший' пройект скажем какой-то L1 ... и обозначать ему 'комплетенесс-статус' типа вот типа Я сделал здесь 10 транзакций в течение 3-4 недель на одном кошельке -- заминтил нфт -- проголосовал за один говернанс пропозал -- может зделал гиткоин донейшн -- дискорд привязал к этому аккаунту -- и в основном теперь там комплишн статус он примерно 80% и вообще его больше не трогаем нахуй. Дропнет-дропнет ... не дропнет-не дропнет. Типа писать колоночку: комплишн статус.

[>] [EVMOS_STAKING_1] Evmos staking is only there to have 1$/week to invest into top-ten hinted/confirmed token projects. But don't expect from it astronomic returns. Otherwise it's trading. We are de-facto counting on $EVMOS not to go below 0.7$ (like polygon/matic, which is also a evm) (which is based on speculation) ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Beyond that ... we don't 'invest' into evmos. For like 1000$/month returns we know it's sh*t. Should evmos die/go below 0.7$ then probably find some other 100% blockchain and/or even if we could accumulate a big sum till then (e.g. 1000$ just invest it into some 20% cosmos token or other L1 token (not a protocol))

[>] Q. Daytrading bitcoin: Bitcoin is probably the safest place to store airdropped & mined $$$ (due to 'less rugpullable smart contracts possbilities' and 'less human factor') but still is not the 'main unit of account' ... in a sense that you can ask 'how do you know that bitcoin doesn't go down now to 200$ per bitcoin?' when daytrading bitcoin, but you can't ask the inverse about usdc-to-bitcoin ratio when daytrading usdc.

[>] [GAMBLER_BIAS_1] The reason leverage trading probably won't work in the longer term -- is because of 'human psychology' aka. the 'gambler bias' ('I'm always right! I can't be wrong! Just look at all the successful trades I've made in the past!... I just can't be wrong! ==> Invest more. ==> There's no 'lower bound' to the money you can and will invest. Or is there?).

[>] [NO_LOWER_BOUND_1] No lower bound (aka. where do you stop your losses)? At $100 loss? At $200 loss? Every $ in crypto is an important bonding leverage.

[>] [EXTREME_DEMENTIA_1] Secrert-Crypto is more like for the case that when you 'lost your hanging rope in some closet' 'forgot where you shoved it' ... and 'cannot find ... cannot find ...' ... and ..
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ At least do some over-the-days planning of how much exactly you want to invest, and/or where are you exactly stopping ... or else ... просто откалываться будет этот кусочек с 'дименцией' и просто вещи будут 'вылетать' из головы налево и направо 'куда же Я сунул эту веревку ...' (I cannot, m, even here say, m, that the fear of 'extreme dementia' fear -- will be 'enough' -- to self-discipline myself.
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ Even after you've invested in perps -- document everything! Documenting everything helps 'cut losses' or at least so my and 'Groovy Guy''s hunch says ...

[>] One way to stop losses is to 'not lose martial arts narrative' entirely ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ I think that airdrops are enough to maintain $100 for this document (at least for next few years, after aptos airdrop). Do not go deeper.

[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Point being that life is full of unexpected sharp falls (like zygo 'ostrov'-movie-style mistake) but still, probably, thinking 'ahh ph*ckk it, this life is all about 'luck factor' anyway no matter how hard you innerly try' is probably not the 'least bad trajectory' of when faced with choices.
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ Or at least when you're in such prolonged state of 'f*ck i tried so hard and mishap stiked me and all my efforts were in vain ... so ... wtf bother ... next zygomatic-fracture grade fall is around the corner anyway' - trembling to 'snap out' of such state and trying for outside gps's.

[>] Women: In a sense that if you say that 'bla bla being in a cult for 35 years and denouncing david miscavige of his kind' later on is also a shitty living and 'least bad trajectory' could be still to 'keep hanging' like this then after some time of watching a cult video/podcast an impending doom arises that, m, the women/dudayev issue is unadressed in this, m, so-called 'least bad trajectory' state -- and it is yes sharp and it will yes keep resurfacing ... to the extent that it will 'break me' and not enough to think 'aaa, people in cults even gave birth because the leader just told them so' and then 'treated their children like unrelated objects' ... and it will still most likely will 'break' me ... like, wtf ... in 'wtf, I'm not normal' sense ... so f*ck that -- still going to david miscavige like cult and fack ya all ya scamma!
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ So in that sense the 'strengthener' might be to yes watch 'mra documentaries' and podcasts and get 'late age' context from there too (not only from 'cults documentaries' ...) as that also could help me friction that 'f*ck this all - still need a cult here even though they warned agains those' ... e.g. maybe siphon even more context of 'how people were miserable with women' to 'stabilise' the dick instincts ...

[>>> 1.1.] ^^ А с другой стороны ты явно чувствуешь нутром { 'subtle power plays' / 'subtle coercion dynamics' / tbd1 } all around you - for which - martial arts and nothing else - are yes indicated.

[>] ^^ Or is there even a 'polarisation'? (?)
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Addl (second part of polarisation if there even is a polarisation): 'I'm always surrounded by dogs',, 'It all comes down to force (or else it's sand-in-the-eyes)',, 'Government-backed feminism nonsense overwhelm' ,,

[>] ^^ Basically on one hand: you know, or at least the 'photogenic' younger you - knew -- that 'it all comes down to force no shit and there's no way you're gonna convince me otherwise' ... and henceforth martial arts are completely legit, and worth to die for rather than skip a bjj class.
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ On the other hand, you've said: wtf those martial arts are worse than prison ... even after prison some people get out perfectly photogenic! And this!?!?!? -- Look what this one did to me!?!?!?!
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ But again ... on the very low level gut level -- you still feel that, umm, martial arts are still 'valid' even after a horrific aesthetic injury that some crazy (or hostile) guy in there did to you ... so you're trying 'not to lose' the martial arts narrative 'entirely' and even though tai-chi could be by many accounts considered a laughable form of martial arts by many ... self-rehearsed chin-na is better than no-chin-na at all (or something along these lines)

[>] Martial arts that are done entirely in your head - is a 'mental masturbation' so I suppose some sort of 'dance meditation' with some random not-necessarily-effective martial moves mimicking - if you could do it every (or almost every day) -- you could at least say: 'I [<script name="tried my best">makeQuizElem2('dHJpZWQgbXkgYmVzdA==','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] not to lose martial arts narrative' compared to if you just done them in your head. 
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Because again, the 'it all comes down to force no shit and there's no way you're gonna convince me otherwise' frame still makes at least _some_ sense ... I 'sense' it every f*cking day in some certain gps locations especially ... those subtle, hidden, but definitely 'sensed' 'power plays' ... and even though the format of 'thrill-driven rolling with few partners every week' format - is overwhelming or even would, if properly researched, turn out to be medically incorrect, in a sense that 'thrill' perhaps should not be mixed into a weekly training due to burnouts and injuries (like the one that I had with some fractured bone) 
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ even though the format might turn out to be not correct for all populations -- until it is 'corrected' and such form of 'trauma-aware martial art' would be prominent all over the world and 5-10 clubs in tel aviv would open (like there's now with bjj) ... -- until then I at least do tai-chi kata as to not to lose martial arts narrative entirely ... 'лучше синица в руке чем журавль в небе' итп ...
[>>> 1.1.1.1.] ^^ I wouldn't be the one to do it because - or who knows -- but at least do a f*cking tai-chi excercise daily you can do (and smoking) -- so first pls establish a consistent tai-chi regular activity (without smoking) -- and then and only then you could worry about 'opening your own trauma aware dojo' (but if you start smoking once again -- then close theere fokkr dojo again) ...

To Recap:
[>] Q. Why just copy-catting jwing ming chin-na books and dvd's into your head - is not enough and you should do some stupid tai-chi kata? ==> 'Don't lose martial arts entirely' narrative is not kept then, if it's all done in your head .. e.g. if you assume that, m, a laptop/pc is an 'extension of human brain' ...  
[>] Q. Why immediately jumping to watching bjj seminar vids and/or even reading bjj book every day - after you sense coercive violence all around -- is probably not such a good idea? ==> A1: 'Shame-induced self-harm' ==> 'Как ты смеешь вообще с таким лицом наружу показываться, ты [<script name="урод несусветный">makeQuizElem2('0YPRgNC+0LQg0L3QtdGB0YPRgdCy0LXRgtC90YvQuQ==','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] !?!?!' ==> Иногда у меня бывают такие 'эпизодики' с самим собой (!!) и иногда они доходят до само-брутальностей над собой (!!) ...

[>] ^^ Sometimes I just can't f*cking _touch_ books e.g. cults books, even after watching hours on hours of podcasts -- which is some sort of a hidden indicator of some sort -- everything appears 'normal' on the surface ... but on the other hand I can watch podcasts for hours and still be unable to just touch a f*cking book!
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ So maybe this could be some sort of 'indicator' of how deep in twilight zone etc.. (unable to earn crypto don't know why etc.)

So what are some books that could help me 'palpate' where I am in the 'gloom' spectrum ==> so obviously cults books (e.g. find out where you stopped previously yesterday or a few days ago etc...) ... (?)

[@ ^ 1.] Fiction books -
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Sometimes I get a 'fog' of where I were with a fiction book ... ==> Just find where I am ...
[@ ^ 1.1.] Book: Leviathan wakes ... (both on flibusta and libgen,, goodreads finalist 2013). ==> tbd1,,

[@ ^ 2.] Bjj book - eventually I can't touch it because on the other hand the zygomatic photogenic face destruction was the, m, on the grade of 'ostrov' movie grade mistake -- that, like, an individual never, like never, gets forgiven for it. And the whole 'not giving up on martial arts entirely' problem (amidst sensing subtle 'power plays' (irregardless of whether I'm now photogenic or not) is NP-hard because of that 'ostrov' mistake ... so henceforth starting with some mild 'do not give up on martial arts entirely' type books and hoping that that one is 'chewable' so I don't 'self cut into little pieces' ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ As I've said, if you start with chin-na book it's also not good ... because if it's 'only in your head' then it kind of seems that you have yes given up on martial arts entirely if before practicing any 'moves' (even the barely resembling some functional moves) you say 'you did enough, enough enough -- don't touch don't touch don't touch' and eventually just read read read and don't practice sh*t ==> So here is probably is tai-chi book (where at least you 'dance out' some martial arts elements) is 'best bet' ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ Apparently with 'dancing out' 'martial moves' there's no 'don't touch don't touch don't touch' immediately firing before even starting ... but rather lets me finish the 'dance out' ... at least _something_ that is not _entirely in the head_ ... 
[@ ^ 2.1.] ^^ Still haven't figured this out yet ...

[@ ^ 3.] ...

[@ ^ 3.] Cults books
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Нету места мне в мире этом и по всему этому израилю миша меня опередил по всему израилю поверх и поперек. Не нахожу себе места в мире проклятом этом после того как сотворили надо мной что сотворили.
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Что бы Я не делал - как бы не извивлялся - мишин сын растет (и может еще там планируется ...) ... мщю ли Я -- помирился ли Я ... и не факт что у людей рождаются сыновья вообще -- после пяти дочерей итп ... 

[@ ^ 4.] Dating & Human-mating books (& grounding on them via mra documentaries and podcasts)
[@ ^ 4.1.] ^^ Иногда когда Я типа пребываю в состояниях что Я не вижу 'десяти-часовой стратегии вылеза' из состояния в котором Я сейчас нахожусь (типа один такой пример это когда в рестинг дей у тебя закрыт доступ к крипто-транзакзицям например (а так когда открыт доступ к таковым -- то вроде пока еще микро-апдейтс этого документа вместе там с сваппингом, ре-стейкингом, и говернанс-вотингом вроде пока 'держит' как 10-часовая стратегия вылеза из 'сумрачных состояний')) - то тогда в таких случаях может быть все-таки да прибегать и к таким мерам (по крайней мере это да работало 2022.11.06))
[@ ^ 4.1.1.] ^^ Рашионала она такая: (1) Что типа эирдроп хантинг - это хреновая, не-совсем-стабильная стратегия. (2) Индие-крипто лайфтайм нарратив - это более стабильная стратегия, но тут громадная пропасть которая 'всплывает' тогда -- что мне уже 44 почти и меня диким образом предала семья в том числе мой родной (!!) брат (!!) и так или иначе - половой орган есть и в нем так-же есть кровеносные сосуды. И так-или-иначе когда захочешь вернуться к 'более-стабильному программированию' (или учителю по программированию х/з) - то тогда так или иначе всплывает тема баб и позднего возраста.
[@ ^ 4.1.1.1.] ^^^ И поэтому - тогда чтобы заниматься тем-же самым 'нюхать' хоть как-то этот же самый 'более-стабильный' 'инди-крипто лайфтайм наррэйтиве' то нужно проходить через-эту-тему баб (что раскинь-или-прикинь несомненно травматично и несет с собой секондари эффектс само-по-себе).

[@ ^ 8.] Crypto technology books (tbd1)
[@ ^ 8.1.] ^^ Crypto that you don't talk about is a great 'psychological' and 'fragmented psyche' helper tool (think having a large 'bonding leverage' for 'lipton tea' -- does that affect 'psyche fragmentation' or not (in a sense of having a 'cohesive singular identity')?) ... so crypto technology books help in many ways for example how to store those money more safely ... in which blockchain? In which pow blockchain of all pow blockchains?   
[@ ^ 8.2.] ^^ In some days you can't do 'crypto transactions' ...
[@ ^ 8.3.] ^^ Bridge 3h punishment is a 'lesser bottomless pit' than more major cults out there but again a big bonding leverage can absolutely 'prolong' the '3h punishment' buffer ... in a sense that if '3h punishment is still not enough for you for self-accountability' then you could bond some secret sum of money if you have such sum ... and 'prolong that 3h punishment buffer' and thus come out as a yes 'accountable' person in society you reside in ...
[@ ^ 8.3.1.] ^^ Again without knowing the technology behind it ... crypto is a 'ghost city' for outside investors who just fomo into bitcoin and ethereum ... so you are with your current knowledge are alot like them compared to e.g. some smart contract and/or blockchain concensus dev who knows all concensus mechanisms and all smart contract langs and their 'buffer overflow' hack schemes that are more present in one smart contract language and less present in another ... it's like someone who doesn't do programming much won't know the need for typesafe programming and checking errors at compile time via more tighter contract programming versis less tight as c does it (it just says 'void*' parameter and idk what you pass to me therefore resulting in unforseen errors of 'programmer who forgot')
[@ ^ 8.5.] ^^ In a sense, 'indie-crypto lifetime narrative' elo is yes 'overwhelm' (of an 'unknown kind') whilst 'cryptocurrency elo rating' is not an overwhelm (?) ... and within 'cryptocurrency elo rating' ==> probably 'books' are bigger than ('>') 'farming' (e.g. are higher on 'elo rating') ...
[@ ^ 8.6.] ^^ Reason: Reading crypto technology books help with 'crypto [<script name='nosurf'>makeQuizElem2('bm9zdXJm','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] breach' aka the [<script name='r/nosurf'>makeQuizElem2('ci9ub3N1cmY=','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] hole that crypto [<script name='creates'>makeQuizElem2('Y3JlYXRlcw==','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] (additional lottery-chance 1000$ a year is not worth the r/nosurf hole breach).
[@ ^ 8.7.] ^^ Reason: Compared to 'crypto developer googler' - if you know sound fundamentals of many blockchains could have an edge, when you're amidst a 'coding war' and don't have much time for 'theory' just like knowledge of 'hennessy patterson' book could give an edge, hypothetically, compared to some non-knowledgeable integrity programmer (of the same 'photogenic rating') ... (just trying to come up with reasons here to battle madness of my life situation, sorry!)

[@ ^ 14.] CPTSD Books ('serial humilation')

[@ ^ 16.] DID books (is there a 'rock bottom'?) ...
[@ ^ 16.1.] ^^ Queued Videos for prewatch-grounding in books ==> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoI94Epkjrc,, 

[@ ^ 28.] Programming books are very powerful because the notion of 'the less code -- the more secure the money' -- you harvested from them (tha programming books) ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Whatever ... and how does that help me? That I should root in programming books? After watching programming documentaries? Memrise.com? Tm-srs? (?)

[#] Misc Notes - Distress Books (a subsection of 'Grounding in books')

[>] Preamble: ^^ For completeness - please refer back to section 'grounding_in_books_tag_1,,'
[>] Preamble: Get to those books through appropriate videos but get to books in the end!
[>] Preamble: Q. What if I run out of books or movies on a cetain distress topic (e.g. women/mra)?
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ A1: I'm counting on endless stream of podcasts e.g. r/datingoverfifty themed and even from there I suppose you could harvest context for 'anti feminism legal self defense' in different shades and shapes.
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ Worst case re-read over-and-over (as if preparing to some 'eternal exam') via 1000 repetitions and spice it up with an endless stream of fiction books ...
[>>> 1.1.1.1.] ^^ In a sense, that, distress states are 1000x worse than 'ahh it's just sooo boring' states.

Q&A:
[>] Q. What are some examples of 'distress states'? (which I'm supposedly aiming to resolve via 'hmm,' 'distress books'?)
[>>> 1.1.] A1.1: Shame-induced self-harm polarisation (e.g. 'как ты смеешь показываться с таким лицом наружу вообще?') vs. 'coercion is 'felt' and is does require martial arts training' ..

[>] Q. How are ever books ever helpful with self-harm? ==> A1: Like with 'banano burn' on 'excessive content consumption' ...

Categories:

[>] ^ Cults Books ('beyond white worms' (when imagining that 'white worms' will eventually eat me below ground (a truism))

[>] ^ Women/MRA books ('anti feminism legal self defense') books (living with powerful women in the same building)

[>] ^ CPTSD Books (as for building an excuse, at my fifties, for watching 20 yr/old PU lectures (then there's a f*cking abundance of them and not a shortage ...)) ==> It was f*cking childhood trauma wtf. (but on the flip-side I remain 'coherent') ...

[>] ^ DID Books

[>] ^ Crypto Technology books (sometimes 'crypto cryto voice just won't 'let go' ...)

[>] ^ Baduk book (find where you stopped yesterday (or 5 days ago (if was 'extreme' distress' ...)))

Not distress books (and why not):

[>] ^^ IFS Books - the point being - is if you just 'found' where you were yesterday .. and didn't really progress -- that doesn't mean that ifs stuff is not being internalized! This stuff takes (might take) long to digest ... 
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Sometimes a question pops up: 'Which one of ifs books?' ==> In distress states sometimes you have 'limits problem' so it's Jay Earley Ifs Therapy ==> No bad Parts (Schwartz) ==> Frank Anderson (his 'Therapists' book) ==> Second Edition IFS Therapy by Schwartz ==> All 3 tomes of earley ==> Do not change this, only over-the-days! 
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ IFS Book gives context to chess (via nadine lucas group) and making it 'lesser bottomless pit' in 'chess & katrain player's glasses' (but only if you have those 'glasses' (and you have those glasses by pure incidence from 'interacting' with 'nadine lucas group' ('why don't he ever talk?' / 'Is he spying on us'? && echoline && xyk))

[>] ^ [MINECRAFT_FOR_100_BTC_1] Indie-Minecraft Theory books (OpenGL, C++, etc.) (?) (you said: '100$ in BTC + minecraft' in the beginning of this document ...) ==> I'm kind of divided on whether it's a truly a 'distress book' as it brings ['overwhelm of unknown kind'] (after a few minutes of 'dwelling' on it) ==> So moved to ''after 6pm' distress books' section ... 

[>] Mantuba (dominic obrien) books (will cause fkn* overwhelms to boot)

[>] ^ Guitar and Piano books (need pc tweaking for that (?))

[>] [FICTION_BOOKS_1] Fiction books - if you 'feel bored' by author's verbal diarrhea - then write your own fiction novella ... or keep reading ... sometimes, in 'stuck' 'daytime' petah-tikva it's just so.

[>] Besides crypto-technology books .. probably also books that are related to 'distress coding around this very document' (some js/ts scripts that you wanted to write around this document, etc.)

Additional notes:
[>] ^ IFS Books are not here because real distress states are more like 'psychedelic therapy' that is 'above ifs' kind-of-states ...

[#] Misc Notes - Evening Distress Books (after 6PM (or even after 4-5 PM)) (when I can return home to 'quietness' after bushes) books (a subsection of 'Grounding in books')

[>] ^^ For completeness - please refer back to section 'distress_books_tag_1,,' and furter to 'grounding_in_books_tag_1,,'
[>] Get to those books through appropriate videos but get to books in the end!

[>] Preamble: Daytime survival books -- in regard to sometimes wishing to wait till evening time to get outside (if ever) due to logististial reasons that are related to 'various gps locations'  (e.g. unable to return from bushes to home due to 'noise',, in evening it is 'quiet' (usually))

[>] Q. What am I afraid of, in 'extreme distress' states, before 6PM?
[@ ^ 1.] Опять же - у меня включается 'переключатель' в голове что начинаю видеть 'более глобальную картину' свою жизненную и меня срочно 'выкидывает наружу' ('аф эхад ло алай'/'safe-to-yell zone'/'spacial modicum of safety'/tbd1) ... что, м, в петах-тикве плотности населения - м, проблемматично, м ... потому что надо отъезжать довольно далеко -- и если что-то забыл с собой взять (что часто бывает в дисстрессовых состояниях (т.е. 'забыл ключи итп')) -- то это создает дополнительную ре-травматизацию ... 
[@ ^ 1.1.] 

Categories (with 'omitted' 'distress books')
[>] ^ All the other books from 'distress_books_1' (non-evening) - section ...
[>] ^ Indie-Minecraft Theory books (OpenGL, C++, etc.) (?) (you said: '100$ in BTC + minecraft' in the beginning of this document ...) -- I'm kind of divided on whether it's a truly a 'distress book' as it brings 'overwhelm of unknown kind' -- so creating 'after 6pm' 

Not related to even 'evening distress' (trying to 'weed out'):
[>] ^ Mantuba books (will cause fkn* overwhelms to boot)
[>] ^ Guitar and Piano books (need pc tweaking for that (?))

[#] Misc Notes - Coding around this document - as a supposedly-distress activity 

Preamble:
[>] ^^ Sometimes perpetuals-trading still 'slips in' (and it happens f*cking impulsively! (e.g. yesterday 800$ with solana out-of-the-blue (and it was f*cking luck that I could get out of it ... it immediately went downslope immediately after)).

[>] ^^ Pay attention to 'distress books' as much as possible ...

[>] ^^ Off-shadow trading by 'coding' micro, but useless features around/for/about this document ... just for the sake of coding and steering off perpetuals leveraged trading. If I wrote some useless feature at least I 'killed time' and yet though not lost money like SBF (who leverage-traded FTT? (?))

[>] ^^ Remember that there's 'scripts/utils-staging.js' for in some states when you code, you sometimes get 'delayed' on some other 'perpetuals' screen when switching alt-tab ... 

[>] Leverage/derivatives trading or simply trading of any kind will definitely make 'programming in distress' impossible, because you will be compulsively switching to that trading screen, when switching alt-tab ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ And this document both relies on existence of $100 in bitcoin and also 'coding minecraft' (which was just made impossible, via leverage trading screen comulsive checking).

Warmups (considering its a distress):
[>] Making order in filesystem ...

[>] Reading js/ts books (because the coding is around this document, not 'reactos') ==> Not sure ... whether it will 'blow' or not ...

[>] Again, reminding here -- to read blockchain technology books. (?)

[>] Reminding: chess & baduk books ..

[>] Book: Shibashi book for, m, 'extremely noting' the 'shame-overdose-induced' 'self-harm'

[>] Getting back onto favoxil or at least ruminating about buying it (bridge just didn't 'fly' (for many reasons including 'Jay Wacker'))

[>] Throwing paper (and possibly into the water too) -- when you meet 'complex problems' (b/c 'programming puzzles' sometimes are more 'complex' then some menual, repetitive work such as 'do 5 repetitive swaps on 3 wallets') ==> You write them on paper ==> Sometimes personal stuff 'slips' in there too ... ==> So maybe would be useful to dispose of it from prying eyes.

[>] Book: Tai-chi book for 'not giving up entirely on martial arts narrative' ==> does it belong here or not?
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Like we said, with 'most-likely-corrupt-policemen-involved type of coercion' you could, m, easy talk about 'katrain' and then your 'maintaining same elo level with katrain goes: 'boom!' ...' ... ==> So there's obviously always is a rationale for 'not giving up entirely on martial arts narrative' (and there weren't for 'shame-overdose-induced self-harm' ....) ...

Knocking neighbors (since we had to bring up 'coding' ==> now knocking neighbors theme is 1000x relevant): ==> Moved all to 'knocking\_neighbors\_1,,' section (at next sunday ...) ...

Warmups that probably won't work in here (distress):

[>] Book: What about 'innocence project' books? ==> do they belong here or not? ==> For now moved to 'warmups that probably won't work'.

[>] Minecraft book - even though ...

[#] Misc Notes - Knocking Neighbors - trying to be constructive / trying to stay indifferent ...

[>] Как в анекдоте 'козел! козел! --> сам ты козел! --> Буууууууммммммммм!'
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Что типа из далекого прошлого х/з помню что типа когда слишком сильно двигают диванами - это значит что меня ждет что-то на примере 'unexpected bad surprise' в плане того что что-то тривиальное такое да пролетит: или в субботу останусь без продуктов питания, или выеду наружу без заряженного телефона, без туалетной бумаги в сумке (которую туда вчера хотел положить еще), без заряженного велосипеда ... итп ... странная вещь ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ Будем честны с собой - 'странная' 'дименция' ... в таких-или иных дозах у меня все-таки наблюдается -- как не стыдно это признать!!! (A voice says that might be related to 'limits problem' ('starky out!'))

Trying to stay indifferent:
[>] Представь что человек (какой-то душевный инвалид или пенсионер) сидит на стуле 24 часа у себя в квартире (или это женщина-инвалидка или пенсионер) и у него 'нервозный рефлекс такой' что он тихо сидит и вообще типа замкнутый такой почти ни с кем не разговаривает но раз в 1-2 минуты он просто обязан подвинуть стул на котором он сидит. Типа злиться на нервозные порывы такие или на людей которые вот в таком состоянии находятся -- бессмысленно. Типа че ты на него срывайся не срывайся он всеравно будет двигать стулом своим раз в 5 минут. Хоть ты его дубинкой поколоти. Всеравно он пока не умрет - будет продолжать раз в 5 минут двигать свой сидетельный стул. Побьешь его дубинкой -- он впадет в обморок -- очнется --- и всеравно через пять минут начнет опять двигать стул. И сага продолжается (?)

[>] [RAMAT_GAN_BNEY_BRAK_BOUNDARY_IF_1] Knocking neighbors do not drive with me to { 'bney-brak' <--> 'ramat-gan-boundary' } every day (so in that sense they are not the only culprit (in a sense of 'corrupt-police-involved-here' coercion.))

[>] [ABOVE_FIVE_SENSES_1] It is possible that some coercion that I'm feeling is beyond auditory/visual/olfactory/kinesthetic (not included here 'taste') - senses ... e.g. not 'knocks' nor anything I 'see' either ... it's just some sort of a 'gut feeling' but beyond auditory/visual/olfactory/kinesthetic senses ... that yes does 'coerce me' but not through something that I can see/hear/smell/sense-via-a-touch (I mean we're going off-grids here but, the point that I'm making is that sometimes when I'm getting mad at knockos -- I definitely had moments and 'ifs parts' saying to me -- that I did wrong by doing so (by reacting angrily onto them (in a sense that, m, if someone yells 'goat! goat!' and you 'react angrily to him' then you might not see the real goat later.)))

[>] [YOU_ARE_GONNA_LOSE_1] If you're fighting on a 'metaphysical level' most likely you are going to lose. Because the battle is not 'well-defined'. Where is loss? Where is a 'win'? ==> Sooo ==> you're gonna lose 99.999% (e.g. some example would be probably: 'interstellar shove into the abyss scene' (?) (I'm just speculating here, sorry...)).

[#] Misc notes: Zyogmatic Shame Factor Amortizers

[>] Preamble maintain 'katrain elo' ==> ... still, under enough physical threat coercion you could theoretically speak about anything ... including katrain ... even about katrain and then pfffft ==> gone your 'elo' like it did with chess ... ==> Visitin various gps locations sometimes helps snap out of that everpresent, unbeatable, invincible 'sense' of 'coercion' ==> Visiting various gps locations has sometimes 'shame factor' problem (e.g. 'как ты смеешь показываться с таким уродливым лицом наружу, собака проклятая!' ==> [which eventually in 'extreme doses' leads to] ==> 'self harm') ==> But again studing martial arts, before moving gps between various gps locations, after that 'photogenic face destruction' ostrov-movie-grade mistake, or doing any martial arts activities before 6pm does/will accentuate that 'shame factor' by a factor of 10x ==> causes you to want self-hospitalise a few days after (?)) ==> ^^ So I made another section called 'zygomatic shame factor amortizers - try 1' (?) (and here we are) (torevise, tbd1)

[>] Amortizers: guitar, piano, faucets, studying foreign languages (somehow, or anyhow) (?)
[@ ^ 1.] Faucets (with prelude-leading to 'incentivized testnets') ==> A very potent shame factor amortizer,, but, ==> not possible at weekends, a rabbithole of its own (airdrop farming is like f*cking gambling)

[@ ^ 1.] ^^ If something goes wrong (it did happen once - with 'ifs elo') -- go back / retract to 'maintaining the same elo level with katrain' - it still works ...
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Drawing - probably not (as there is very little 'competition context') ...
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ We need/want that for 'bjj & chin-na' spindown as seemingly just katrain/mom/civ/tetris-attack just don't seem to 'cut' it on their own alone-wise ...
[@ ^ 3.] ^^ It seems that tai-chi (aka. 'martial arts meditation' (as opposed to yoga, which is a 'postures' meditation)) is a 'part of' maintaining same elo level with 'bjj&chin-na'? E.g. 'do at least some 'farthest resemblance' movement? (?) (?) (?)
[@ ^ 3.1.] ^^ Or maybe I'm wrong? (?) (?) (?)
[@ ^ 3.1.1.] ^^ There's no 'maintaining the same elo level with tai-chi kata' because tai-chi is the actually one from which the whole idea of 'keeping _at least_ the same elo level with katrain' hyper-focus came from ... in a sense that it says ... 'at least don't lose martial arts at all if you have bjj painful fracture ... because martial arts are _so_, _so_ important' and 'probably self-rehearsed 'mostly theoretical only' chin-na is better than no chin-na knowledge altogether, even theoretical' from that 'at least don't lose martial arts entirely' probably came the understanding: 'don't lose katrain entirely' ... ==> so supposedly copy-catting chin-na as per jwing ming's books & dvd's (you have both, also for martial applications of it) supposed to 'keep' that 'elo' 'hyper-focus' ==> So I suppose what it should be is: 'copy-catting chin-na and it's martial applications as perfectly as possible' and the best you can make of it ==> Try 'trembling' for it ... who knows ... ==> tbd1,,
[@ ^ 4.] [IFS_1] ^^ Is there 'maintaining the same ELO' with ifs? ==> Seems like not so it means that ifs is a 'bottomless pit' yet in some certain situational overwhelm situations it is very useful... and there are a lot of overwhelming situational situations in certain specific GPS locations ... ==> tbd1,,
[@ ^ 4.1.] ^^ Also: ifs is not a bottomless pit in a sense that if a specific individual is in some cult (or jumping between cults) ... then ifs provides an 'academically-refined' cult which is a 'less' 'bottomless pit' than some other 'cults' that exist out there ... due to 'academia-peer-review' property of it ...,, but still tbd1
[@ ^ 4.1.1.] ^^ So in a sense ifs is not a 'bottomless pit' but rather is a 'lesser' 'bottomless pit' which is good for segments of population who reside in a 'bottomless pit' (e.g. cults followers who do not realise and/or blackout within them, the harmful effects of their cults)...
[@ ^ 6.] ^^ Is there 'elo level' regarding 'digital minimalism' and 'extreme privacy' (a.k.a. michael bezzel? (?)) ==> Apparently can't touch that because moving to ramat aviv is on a 'higher note' than 'worrying about extreme privacy' because if I'm not 'careful' then the whole shebang of being near 'internet' & 'privacy' could be 'taken away' from me ... so it's secondary unfortunately (and things will inevitably 'spill' the painful ones which shouldn't ...)
[@ ^ 6.1.]
[@ ^ 7.] ^^ Just curious - is there 'elo level' with bridge? ==> Well yep if you sit 3h bridge marathon with Oren Lidor and/or Doron Yadlin -- you will either score less or score more or equal -- and that determines your elo level compared to them ... 
[@ ^ 7.1.] ^^ This elo level is rather 'sparse' compared to chess e.g. statistical-rather but in overall sense if you run 10-days marathon against one of them ... then their { (1) Memorisation of bidding language. (2) Knowledge to recognise of signals when playing hand. (3) A little bit of algorighmic thinking of how to play and what not to play depending on what partners played (but this algorithmic thinking is much less 'deep' than chess) (4) ? } ==> will to a large extent determine whether they win or a lose in points in that 10 days marathon. But then again, this is not a 'measure' of anything ... e.g. their algorithmic thinking might be more 'mediocre' than a chess player ... their 'language of bidding' knowledge -- might be due to them having inherited that from their rich parents from childhood ... just like french was a language of 'high circles' in some non-french societies ... but again the purpose of this is mostly about not the 'elo' but rather having some sort of alternate venue of connecting with people / making connections with people ... but then again ... this is not the sole way of making connections ... and it's possible that existence of interconnected internet has made this 'bridge' lucrativity even more obsolete ... as one could simply invest in making an arbitrage bot and blow all the bridge people out of the water ... I mean in a sense that 'bridge' was some sort of 'gamble-pointing of a finger' when you were out of options ... and so you saw e.g. some ad in tel-aviv university sports club and thought: ha! this must be it! ... but it is very possible that for example working with parts and interrogating them with protector questions ... in retrospect ... wouldn't bring you to any 'bridge' seeking altogether. E.g. in a sense of: nothing's broke -- don't apply any sort of 'band-aid' on top of it ... it's like more like carrying some notion of 'if it's all so seemingly 'too calm'' then 'add even more overwhelm on top of it' -- 'and then it all will become clear!' sort of mindset .. which might in retrospect not overwhelm -- the already overwhelmed & mega-traumatised system.
[@ ^ 7.1.1.] ^^ When nobody talks ... there's not to 'bring yourself to people' to cause additional overwhelm on the system, that might in fact, be traumatised and needed more of that ramat aviv immersion ...
[@ ^ 7.1.1.1.] ^^ Probably even 4.30 wouldn't exist and many things wouldn't exist should I have known about 'nonsense lana physicist' much earlier on.
[@ ^ 7.1.1.1.1.] ^^  William Kingdon Clifford: "'It is wrong, always, everywhere and for any one, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence.'"
[@ ^ 8.] ^^ Is there 'cryptocurrency elo rating'? (aka. 'elo rating pertaining to cryptocurrency')
[@ ^ 8.1.] ^^ Blockchain & Crypto Technology books are probably '>' (bigger) in that domain-or-realm, than 'airdrop farming' ... (considering that plain 'indie-crypto lifetime narrative' is 'overwhelm' ...) 
[@ ^ 8.1.1.] ^^ In a sense that 'dry studying' of that technology somehow helps more than just plain farming/sybilling (although counter-intuitive (wtf does studying even help?!?!? (?)))) ...
[@ ^ 8.2.] ^^ Reading a substantial chunk of crypto-technology-or-blockchain-technology [<script name='book'>makeQuizElem2('Ym9vaw==','&lt;pomflh&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] before doing any faucets and/or airdrops? (?) (in a sense of 'which is higher elo level?' - wise)) -- you have staking already ... so ... 
[@ ^ 8.2.1.] ^^ What I'm trying to get to - is to do only minimalist super-obvious airdrop farming ... and like 2-3 precalculated steps (didn't need to jerky-signup for neither ampleforth, nor optimism, nor stargaze, nor evmos, nor aptos, nor paraswap, nor cowswap, etc.) ... jerky-signups definitely f*cks me up. And a 'book' before faucets could get me into an appropriate mood before jumping onto twitter? (?)
[@ ^ 9.] [WOMEN_1] ^^ Is there such a thing as a 'dating elo rating' (as in r/datingoverfifty)? Or lack-of-dating-thereof elo-rating? In a sense that, m, it could be probably related to why ''indie-crypto lifetime narrative' elo rating' is an overwhelm, compared to 'cryptocurrency elo rating' ... ? (?) (?) (?)
[@ ^ 9.1.] ^^ Maybe it's just 'living around women' elo (without involving any sort of 'dating' or 'datingoverfifty' or 'lack-of-dating',, yet ...)
[@ ^ 9.2.] ^^ The horrid reality that ~ 30% of people don't know -- is that residental buildings (everywhere?) are dominated by women ... and by reading MRA materials you achieve two things: (1) To gather context and see also the ugly side of women unlike your reproductory organ wants to 'idealise',, and (2) Hopefully understanding of an importance of why tho f*** you should leave residential buildings from time to time (they are not really 'safety heaven') -- one of this techniques, by the way which you learned from Owen Cook about that dirty unstiffling sh*t that women do all the time. That context you got from mra/redpill. Was it helpful or harmful instead? ==> G-d knows. ... but in a sense ... it somewhat resembles the 'seeing through the matrix' analogy-or-metaphor (in a very dark and unhealthy sense, though). So jury is out on that one ... but anyway - the knocks are persistent, and are definitely an annoyance at times (bpd/did women? (?))
[@ ^ 9.2.1.] ^^ Point being: mra/redpill does help with some survival tricks where no one will explain. But only whisper. It got you f*cked, for sure, but then it also got -- internet is a double-edged sword ... point being is that ... sometimes in super-stuck states when I feel that I am what-ifs-cornered and crawling on ceilings for hours -- watching that context -- provides relief and nothing else is known to me which provides relief in those particular what-ifs-cornered-type-of-situations. Maybe I'll find it someday - but for now it's that.
[@ ^ 9.2.1.1.] ^^ To be able to find/spot/act-upon 'weaknesses' in seemningly flawless americanized female lawyers / female judges ... (for the aim of 'legal-self-defense') (is such thing even ever possible?) (?)
[@ ^ 9.2.1.1.1.] ^^ Get to books don't just stop at documentaries (that is a generic higher elo from experience in other parallel domains)
[@ ^ 10.] ^^ Is there ''indie-crypto lifetime narrative' elo rating' (aka. 'elo rating' pertaining to 'indie-crypto narrative') 
[@ ^ 10.1.] ^^ That is seemingly unfortunately is 'overwhelm' of some 'unknown kind' (when you had 8-9k$ - this was not an overwhelm) so unfortunately go back to 'cryptocurency elo rating' and dwell there? (?)

<div hidden>tag: ifs_elo_elaboration_1,,</div>
[#] Misc Notes - IFS ELO elaborations (if there's ever such thing like 'ifs-interrelated elo-rating')

[@ ^ 4.] [IFS_1] ^^ Is there 'maintaining the same ELO' with ifs? ==> Seems like not so it means that ifs is a 'bottomless pit' yet in some certain situational overwhelm situations it is very useful... and there are a lot of overwhelming situational situations in certain specific GPS locations ... ==> tbd1,,
[@ ^ 4.1.] ^^ Also: ifs is not a bottomless pit in a sense that if a specific individual is in some cult (or jumping between cults) ... then ifs provides an 'academically-refined' cult which is a 'less' 'bottomless pit' than some other 'cults' that exist out there ... due to 'academia-peer-review' property of it ...,, but still tbd1

[>] ^^ One point is that 'talking about ifs' would definitely be a 'low' 'elo rating' because it turns 'mind-os' into 'ban-os' (as in 'banned from all ifs therapists' because talked about ifs to everybody, and then need to pay SteveP $$$$$ dollors and in case of ifs -- probably a ban) ...
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ And here you lost me (but what's left now is either 'chess' to avoid talking or a large bonding leverage (which unfortunately after do kwon I don't have)  ... (and henceforth we try and maintain) ...
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ In case of 'chess' - ?

[#] Misc Notes - Aspects of 'Not giving up entirely on martial arts' entirely - misc aspects I want addressed (in-between-days) narrative

[>] The 'overdose-of-shame overdose' 'self-harm' aspect
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ For now it's 'symbolized' by shibashi? (?)

[>] The 'schnitzel' aspect ...
[@ ^ 1.] Whilst visualising -- it's difficult to be a 'vegeterian bjj fighter' even if I plan to come there once in 5-10 years ... just eat a tiny fokking piece of schnitzel.

[>] [OUTSIDE_1] [FREE_TO_YELL_ZONE_1] The 'free-to-yell' zone/place (after 6PM or sometimes even before) - aspect
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Even if I'm doing tai-chi at home -- supposedly want to get outside in the evening - and try to perform it outside for the second time ... because the demonic emotions sometimes are still stuck and want to be 'yelled out' when I can 'safely' 'yell them out' (there are not many such places in gush dan, unfortunately -- and are getting less and less so).

[>] [CHESS_1] The 'Chess' aspect ... ==> Q. Wtf is chess important not to omit when dealing with 'not giving up entirely on martial arts'?
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ With e.g. bjj -- you're still suspectible to 'cult mind control'.
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ Competition, and/or 'sensing boundaries' with other 'competitive men' almost throws 'dementia' 'out of the window' (but this doesn't come for 'free' -- it's with enormously demonic emotions though). 
[@ ^ 2.1.] ^^ But what the f*ck dementia has to do with 'martial arts entirely narrative' ==> 'Achievement' && 'Forgetfulness' is rather a dangerous combustion.

[>] Not getting 'provocated' by knocking neighbors at any cost. Imagination. Wildly. 

Additional factors:

[>] The 'this guy is too old and he's trying' shame ('haha!') factor ... ==> Probably for me the coercive abuse or whatever that is - just doesn't stop with age -- just shtaktel ya shmaktel. ==> So kind of redirect it into 'ahh, I want 150 million $ bitcoin (the form of money that is not dependent on some specific person giving it to me) -- not shameful at any age'

[#] Misc Notes - Shore Border, prison and freedom narrative 

[>] Basically, the idea of visiting ramat aviv every 72 hours, is because (1) If I delay it for 'too long' then traveling there - even after 48+ hours of staying there nearby (or near) (or adjacent to) the seashore -- I still won't be able to find a difference between prison and freedom (*1) ... and will fall asleep uncontrollably (*2) ... and then I will be forcefully taken! (which is unwanted? (?) (<-- haha! lol! ... --> see (*3),(*4) --> lol! lololololololololol!) 
[@ ^ 1.] (*1) ^^ (similar things happened where I couldn't, bluntly in-your-face watching the sea and standing literally near it at night, snap out of, the thought that 'prison is better than freedom' into 'freedom is better then prison') ==> ... so how come this then couldn't come to 'being unable to dissect even after just f*cking 48+ hours staying there' (if I delayed 'myself' in petah-tikva for 'too long'?)) ???
[@ ^ 2.] (*2) (like also happened in yaar bon (I just said f*ck it - I'm laying down wtf ja! ja! - aaand so I did ... and woke up at ~ 7 pm (luckily no one noticed a near-homeless person lying on the ground ...))
[@ ^ 3.] (*3) (and then though, it might require some bueracracy to get out they might 'test' me there for half a year ... one thing is when I myself get 'напасти' and going and trying to snap out ... the other thing entirely is when other people are directly involved and are 'supervising' my 'snapping out' process,) ... (tbd1,,)
[@ ^ 4.] (*4) also I just 'vaguely' remember that no matter what you think _now_ under mild tobacco influence & possibly some other lsd-like toxins that they 'secretly' 'shoved' there,, but after you resided in the same room with 4 foreign people the 'serial humiliation' dynamic (like in handesaim with 'roi') slowly started to 'sneak in' and you wanted out of there like 'off the hot stove' ... so again ... it might be possible that some lsd-like substances in Pall Mall Blue are doing that to me (this 'unable to discern between 'prison' and 'freedom' states) ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Need a functioning alarm clock in the f*cking house!

<div hidden>tag: shibashi_1,, grimacing_shibashi_1,,</div>
[#] Shibashi or Norbekov or Qi Gong Summary - tbd1,,

Rationale:
[>] Grimacing Shibashi helps with 'shame-induced' 'self-harm' e.g. 'как ты смеешь показываьтся с таким лицом наружу, ск*тина пр*клятая!' - like states that could potentially in extreme doses lead to self-headslaps, and 'beyond headslaps' ... (tbd1,, copy more exact phrasing from somewhere else)
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Tai-chi in itself, is concerned with martial arts (see some other section for that) so it doesn't 'care' not 'want to know' about 'shame induced self-harm' ...

[>] I don't remember how I put it but it has to do somehow with 'losing face' (or 'saving face' innuendos) e.g. what you do in shibashi all those excercises -- they translate to real-world later when you meet faces with people -- how? But, it helps ...

[>] [DRAFT_1] ^^ War-of-grimaces -- tbd1 -- manifesting grimacing outside helps with rite-of-passage (...)

Jose
Ortega y Gasset said the metaphor is the
most powerful tool known to humankind
I'll bet many of the negotiators and
mediators on this call have had the
experience of how a well timed well
chosen and evocative metaphor can help
unlock the dispute resolution process
this metaphor of parts is not new Plato
had the notion that we have parts to the
two horses the positive and the negative
energies and the charioteer the tries to
manage them Freud of course thought we
had parts the ideo and super-ego
the idea that we have parts is one that
scholars in our field have been writing
about of late billiary Erica Fox Garry
Friedman all of these books take as
their premise that we are engaged in an
internal negotiation all the time all of
us and the people that we work with as
well this article from several years ago
1998 by Max bazerman and colleagues is a
wonderful introduction to this concept
in this article the authors talk about
us having basically two cells the want
self which is impulsive and the should
self which is rational in this a more
recent article by Bob Borden and
colleagues talking about how the
internal negotiation over our identity
and role plays an important function in
our negotiations and then in the
materials the for this talk you may have
seen a link for this article and also
for this shorter article and when you
get the slides if you want to access
these articles you'll have links to them
finally in terms of this being a a model
that is out there in the world if you
have not seen the Academy award-winning
movie inside out I encourage you to see
it it depicts each of the people in the
film it's an animated film with these
five parts inside who are negotiating
all the time over what each of the
protagonists in the in the film are
going to to do it's both entertaining
and enlightening and it was actually
developed with some help from one of the
psychiatrists in the IFS field ...
