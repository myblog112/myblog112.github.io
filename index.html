Hopefully, this is 'top-level enough' (above hackmd.io, cryptpad, discord, etc ... so I'll be able to 'trackback to it all the time' ...

==> https://twitter.com/martian_wallet/status/1580959500995301376?s=20&t=VJnUSYWkeBe5dzEpjSOEqw
===> ^^ They suggest to join their discord and look for hints ... anyway ... this is soo out of priority -- try in the next 2-4 weeks ... [2022.10.20] ... otherwise
