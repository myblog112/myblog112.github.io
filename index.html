Hopefully, this is 'top-level enough' (above hackmd.io, cryptpad, discord, etc.) ... so I'll be able to 'trackback' [<script name="'trackback'">makeQuizElem2('J3RyYWNrYmFjayc=','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] to it all the time ...
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ This is definitely a [<script name="problem">makeQuizElem2('cHJvYmxlbQ==','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>], that is 'shameful' to admit existence of it ... but again, 'fingers in elecric socket' reflex polarisation ...
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ Again, the problem being, that unless I got some ~ 100-200$ usd in crypto -- this document merely becomes a mere 'another document in filesystem' and I have this 'lost in filesystem' syndrome ...
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ You can blame synchronious knockos on this, but it also sometimes feels like this is even above knockos ... e.g. think municipality (city municipality) and/or government level problem ... like. if you 'remove' knockos, somebody else will 99% come in their place

[>] Rootedness (aka 'rememberance') of this document is related to existence of 32-bit minecraft and at least 100$ in bitcoin (or most TVL POW (non-coropration) coin) ... that's my current take on it ... e.g. 'the more complex the code - the more vulnerable the money' ... (and also 'the less human factor' -- the more safer the money) ... and so ... before airdrops -- do I have at least 100$ in bitcoin so that this document keeps being remembered?

[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Immigration precisely to ramat aviv was a matter of 'luck' (?)
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ Удержать свою связь с 'рамат авивским' ['immigration precisely to ramat aviv was a matter of luck' - 'Я'] пока находишься в этом микрорайоне (там тоже такое есть но гораздо меньше ощутимо потому что поток русских и иностранных туристов и смешиваешься с ними и не 'singled out' 'waaaaay too obviously' (они ненавидят белых ашкеназов и даже на мусорных ящиках это пишут!! Рядом с бензоколонкой на ул. гиссин ... или х/з какая другая причина ... гомогенная среда которая ненавидит 'чужаков' они все с друг другом на балкончиках сидят и это часть их 'тайтли-книт коммьюнити'/'tightly-knit community' (?)).

[>] Relation of 'crypto bonding leverage' to 'ifs' and 'dangeli' ... ==> is that if you ever talk about ifs anywhere then you're a 'guru' and then you'll have to overpay SteveP 10,000$ ... and in case of 'IFS' will probably not 'overpay to an ifs therapist' but rather ban from an 'ifs therapist' because he will consider you 'too diffucult' a patient and 'will part with you' 'gently' (everything is for sale) ... 
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ And to bond 'talking/not talking' about ifs with thousands of $$$$ ...

[>] The relation between katrain and crypto? ==> Crypto is needed to shut up and not talk on ifs forums because of parallel between 'Pay SteveP 10000$' phenomenon and 'IFS Therapists Landscape Ban' (which would parallely happen if you 'tell everybody how great IFS is' just like as it would with if you told everybody (['sad'] wink,wink ;) !!) how great 'Stephane' is which would lead you to 'The Guru' aka SteveP and it would not be 'cheap' ...)
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ And with crypto the whole 'airdrop farming' shebang is extremely 'noisy' and 'non-linear' and has 'resting day' 'inner conflict' (is it money or not?) aka though it is helpful in extreme states of psyche -- it 'wants' to be 'minimised' and yet it's 'very difficult' to be minimised (probably to 'bitcoin' and 'rvn mining card') and no 'internet' involvement whatsoever ... ==> And chess/go/baduk is also there as a 'tool' to 'shut up' about the same 'stephane' and 'stevep' and 'ifs' ... as in 'don't give out chess pieces' or give a 'minimal possible' chess pieces to be able to survive the later onset of SteveP overwhelm.

[>] What's the relation of 'mom'/'civ' and crypto? ==> Basically the same as the relation between katrain and crypto (see above), but, sometimes, when you feel when you are going to fly to 'Melahim Be-Rotschild' -- playing 'Mom'/'Civ'/'Ufo-Ea' can help you with confidence that you can still study chess/go to a decent level, without needing external help. 

[>] What's the relation between 'tetris attack' and 'crypto'? ==> Basically as with katrain and crypto - there are 2 problems: (1) Crypto is used to 'bond' against talking about IFS which is disasterous to the extent of 'banned by all ifs therapists' yet the 'sleep doctor didn't yet reach his final verdict' (see more detailed explanation in some other doc (this one is a public doc)). (2) Crypto in itself has problems, such as: (2.1.) A conflict with nosurf (aka fills my head with unneccessant twitter noise all the time when I want is a quiet trauma processing with a fiction book). (2.2.) 'Resting day' 'inner conflict' ... (3) (tbd1,,)
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ And when you get banned from all ifs therapists -- obviously the first thing the [inner] critics will say 'what. a. fucking. idiot. have. you. been.' ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ Definition from wikipedia: 'Idiot' was formerly a technical term in legal and psychiatric contexts for some kinds of profound intellectual disability where the mental age is two years or less, and the person cannot guard themself against common physical dangers.
[>>> 1.1.1.1.] ^^ And yet idiots rarely solve puzzles there seems to be an 'inverse' correlation between an 'idiot' aka. 2 year old child who can barely walk ... and someone who is good at solving non-trivial puzzles quickly. ...
[>>> 1.1.1.1.1.] ^^ And somehow, since 'getting banned' from 'ifs therapists landscape' is 'being such an idiot' then maybe playing tetris attack could, sort of, somehow, 'negate' that before that happened (due again to 'inverse correlation' between an idiot and someone who is good at 'solving some non-trivial puzzles for speed') ... by 'spinning' some sort of 'rusty' 'cog' wheel in the head ... that will 'fire' when I'm about to say something 'wrong' to an ifs therapist that I would normally not notice if I woudn't have trained myself to 'solve non-trivial puzzles quickly' at all ... 

[>] Just like there's 'maintaining the same level' of elo with katrain ... there's also maintaing the same level of some sort of 'elo-like rating' with 'tetris attack' ... (e.g. can you solve/spot 10 matches a minute or is it now only being able to spot 1 match only per 10 minutes)? -- so it is kind of a rate-y too ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Also with 'mom'/'civ' there exists elo-like rating (of some sort) (which is not official but you can get a sense when you've 'deteriorated' too much on that 'meta' scale) ...

[>] Definitely reading blockchain [<script name='technologies'>makeQuizElem2('dGVjaG5vbG9naWVz','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] books _all week_ (not just in 'resting day') could help you not drown further into 'ProblemWebSurfing' airdrop farming madness ...

[>] Maybe install & maintain Brown Dust and Langrisser (gather daily diamonds ...) so you'd have something to do at weekend ..
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ After all he even blackmails you with offline games ...

[>] If I'm that strong that people 'sneeze' due to my thoughts, or that smart that I deserve some sort of a nobel prize (or multiple/several nobel prizes), then how come I've not yet got 150 million in bitcoin? (I said that when I got ~ 150 million - then I can airdrop)

[>] Is there '[<script name='untameable/uncontrollable'>makeQuizElem2('dW50YW1lYWJsZS91bmNvbnRyb2xsYWJsZQ==','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] running commentary that just won't stop' lurking there? (?)

[>] Crypto minimalism ==> Ideally, farming should be achieved with a few mining cards. And no involvement with 'web3' whatsoever.

[>] In crypto chats you should 'shut up' even if it might mean that you lose 1000$ ... -- because the whole point (or one major point) of 'bonding leverage' is 
because you lack (lacked) 'self-disciplining' to be able to shut up about other topics such as 'IFS and Stephane and SteveP 10000$ and IFS Therapists Ban' ... and 
if you open yourself up to communication with some possibly angry and 'unreasonable' mod with whom you might be needing to negotiate 'unban' now ... then you 'set 
yourself up' for a 'hole in self disciplining' which you were lacking in the first place and came to 'bonding leverage' just exactly because of that one problem (!!) ...
(re-read this very paragraph from the beginning (maybe a few times (not trying to be 'offending' here))) ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ So the rule of thumb is - to never, ever talk -- even if it loses us 1000-2000$ ...

[>] Don't forget about [<script name='Eckhart Tolle/Hanan Sagiv narrative'>makeQuizElem2('RWNraGFydCBUb2xsZS9IYW5hbiBTYWdpdiBuYXJyYXRpdmU=','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] when you conversing with parents ... or you gonna fall and never find, never find ...

[>] 'Paralyzing Fame Residue'/'Compliments Overwhelm'/'Grandiosity overwhelm' ==> [This is not 100% bulletproof but] ==> Play with { 'still haven't got [<script name='150 million $'>makeQuizElem2('MTUwIG1pbGxpb24gJA==','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] bitcoin if I'm that very smart huh how come' } narrative (and also 'I can airdrop only when I have 150 million $ in bitcoin and I'm short of that sum so far) (?)
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ It works 'better' because basically I could have that sum without anyone on the planet earth knowing (compared to fiat money)...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ 'That was heroism what you did today!' ==> 'But that heroism wasn't enough to get me to [<script name='150 million $'>makeQuizElem2('MTUwIG1pbGxpb24gJA==','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] in bitcoin, wasn't it? (?)' (?) 
[>>> 1.1.1.1.] ^^ That is valid as long as I got [<script name='24h internet connection'>makeQuizElem2('MjRoIGludGVybmV0IGNvbm5lY3Rpb24=','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] & some [<script name='privacy'>makeQuizElem2('cHJpdmFjeQ==','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>].

[>] What's the relation of 'knocking neighbors' to 'redpill/mra' videos? ==> 'Government-backed [<script name='feminism nonsense'>makeQuizElem2('ZmVtaW5pc20gbm9uc2Vuc2U=','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] overwhelm' vs. 'dick existence' polarisation ...

[>] { 'Government-backed feminism nonsense overwhelm' vs. 'dick existence' } polarisation needs to be fed 'context' ... both the 'cults' context (because r/datingoverfifty is super-hellish) ... also the mra context (medusa wives existence && you are not alone/isolated/ostracised by govt. backed feminsim nonsense overwhelm && how they cope with it) ... 
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ And maybe also cptsd/ifs/did/academically-backed trauma context ('fantastic beasts and where to find them') (you know about Jay Wacker).
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ This can definitely [<script name='impede'>makeQuizElem2('aW1wZWRl','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] getting outside as you meet eyes with pumped-up Fatma's you just lose all hyper-focus there ever ever ever was ... and most certainly get 'lost' on the way ('how a 'skirt' can make a man 'trip') ...
[>>> 1.1.1.1.] ^^ This just puts them from 'a walking angel'/'i saw an angel' state into some more 'neutral' 'balanced' light (e.g. such as what I got from r/femaledatingstrategy: 'she's going to check the baldness of her future bf's father' etc.) ... and hopefully give you more 'rite of passage' ...
[>>> 1.1.1.1.1.] ^^ There's also some 'dark' sh*t to process like 'I don't fit into the gaussian' and 'Aurelia Brouwers' (if I try to expand on this here --> it really 'dark' sh*t trust me ...) ...

[>] Please be gentle with yourself in a sense that before I found out about no-bad-parts frame, I have been rebelling against my own parts .. after listening to owen cook in a sense that I've learned that I've been 'projecting my ego' onto other people and now I'm not ... I'm above that filthy, despicable low-life level!
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ In a sense that when a 'saving grace' voice appeared -- I've been f*cking rebelling against it instead of asking it protector questions ... so I've done a bunch of stupid things, many of whom might take beyond lifetime (not enough vitality, etc.) to unburden ...

[>] The narrative/motive of 'copycat studying' of 'bjj & chin-na' (copycat I mean via palpating their's books, not youtubs) -- for the sake of 'limits problem' -- never went away nowhere ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ With bjj alone you're still in 'fog' in a sense that 'how do you get him to the ground'? So you need chin-na copycatting too ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ And one important takeaway from this is it although you've lost ~60-70% of do-kwon's money ... it's still important to somehow manage not losing the last 100$ in crypto or else this very document ... I won't be able to navigate to ... and will be [<script name='[lost in filesystem]'>makeQuizElem2('ZmlsZXN5c3RlbQ==','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] forever again.
[>>> 1.1.1.1.1] ^^ So from that I suppose - we must infer our 'testnets' and 'airdrops' participation ... (this 'promised airdrop' 'instability'/'jitteredness' unfortunately still remains ...) as I'm still stuck in petah tikva endless maze.

[>] ^^ So how about 'stay the same elo-like rating' with 'bjj & chin-na' and don't 'deteriorate'?
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Always, always try to [<script name='backtrack'>makeQuizElem2('YmFja3RyYWNr','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] back to 'maintaining the same elo' with katrain/mom/civ/tetris-attack if/when tolerable/possible because amnesia left-and-right ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ So there's a lot of ifs protector clusterf*ckia involved here ... (tbd1,,)
[>>> 1.1.1.1.] ^^ First thing there's [<script name='amnesia'>makeQuizElem2('YW1uZXNpYQ==','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] (dementia? (?)) episodes when I 'jump' straight onto bjj youtube vids (even under theembodimentconference.org) 

[>] ^^ So, if we're talking about 'maintaining existing elo levels' - then are there 'elo levels' of: Foreign & Spoken languages knowledge? Of Guitar & Piano knowledge/skill? Of Drawing? Of Tai-chi? Of Programming? Rpg story/journey games? ==> Moved to separate section ...
``` TODELETE
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ If something goes wrong (it did happen once - with 'ifs elo') -- go back / retract to 'maintaining the same elo level with katrain' - it still works ...
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Drawing - probably not (as there is very little 'competition context') ...
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ We need/want that for 'bjj & chin-na' spindown as seemingly just katrain/mom/civ/tetris-attack just don't seem to 'cut' it on their own alone-wise ...
[@ ^ 3.] ^^ It seems that tai-chi (aka. 'martial arts meditation' (as opposed to yoga, which is a 'postures' meditation)) is a 'part of' maintaining same elo level with 'bjj&chin-na'? E.g. 'do at least some 'farthest resemblance' movement? (?) (?) (?)
[@ ^ 3.1.] ^^ Or maybe I'm wrong? (?) (?) (?)
[@ ^ 3.1.1.] ^^ There's no 'maintaining the same elo level with tai-chi kata' because tai-chi is the actually one from which the whole idea of 'keeping _at least_ the same elo level with katrain' hyper-focus came from ... in a sense that it says ... 'at least don't lose martial arts at all if you have bjj painful fracture ... because martial arts are _so_, _so_ important' and 'probably self-rehearsed 'mostly theoretical only' chin-na is better than no chin-na knowledge altogether, even theoretical' from that 'at least don't lose martial arts entirely' probably came the understanding: 'don't lose katrain entirely' ... ==> so supposedly copy-catting chin-na as per jwing ming's books & dvd's (you have both, also for martial applications of it) supposed to 'keep' that 'elo' 'hyper-focus' ==> So I suppose what it should be is: 'copy-catting chin-na and it's martial applications as perfectly as possible' and the best you can make of it ==> Try 'trembling' for it ... who knows ... ==> tbd1,,
[@ ^ 4.] ^^ Is there 'maintaining the same ELO' with ifs? ==> Seems like not so it means that ifs is a 'bottomless pit' yet in some certain situational overwhelm situations it is very useful... and there are a lot of overwhelming situational situations in certain specific GPS locations ... ==> tbd1,,
[@ ^ 4.1.] ^^ Also: ifs is not a bottomless pit in a sense that if a specific individual is in some cult (or jumping between cults) ... then ifs provides an 'academically-refined' cult which is a 'less' 'bottomless pit' than some other 'cults' that exist out there ... due to 'academia-peer-review' property of it ...,, but still tbd1
[@ ^ 4.1.1.] ^^ So in a sense ifs is not a 'bottomless pit' but rather is a 'lesser' 'bottomless pit' which is good for segments of population who reside in a 'bottomless pit' (e.g. cults followers who do not realise and/or blackout within them, the harmful effects of their cults)...
[@ ^ 6.] ^^ Is there 'elo level' regarding 'digital minimalism' and 'extreme privacy' (a.k.a. michael bezzel? (?)) ==> Apparently can't touch that because moving to ramat aviv is on a 'higher note' than 'worrying about extreme privacy' because if I'm not 'careful' then the whole shebang of being near 'internet' & 'privacy' could be 'taken away' from me ... so it's secondary unfortunately (and things will inevitably 'spill' the painful ones which shouldn't ...)
[@ ^ 6.1.]
[@ ^ 7.] ^^ Just curious - is there 'elo level' with bridge? ==> Well yep if you sit 3h bridge marathon with Oren Lidor and/or Doron Yadlin -- you will either score less or score more or equal -- and that determines your elo level compared to them ... 
[@ ^ 7.1.] ^^ This elo level is rather 'sparse' compared to chess e.g. statistical-rather but in overall sense if you run 10-days marathon against one of them ... then their { (1) Memorisation of bidding language. (2) Knowledge to recognise of signals when playing hand. (3) A little bit of algorighmic thinking of how to play and what not to play depending on what partners played (but this algorithmic thinking is much less 'deep' than chess) (4) ? } ==> will to a large extent determine whether they win or a lose in points in that 10 days marathon. But then again, this is not a 'measure' of anything ... e.g. their algorithmic thinking might be more 'mediocre' than a chess player ... their 'language of bidding' knowledge -- might be due to them having inherited that from their rich parents from childhood ... just like french was a language of 'high circles' in some non-french societies ... but again the purpose of this is mostly about not the 'elo' but rather having some sort of alternate venue of connecting with people / making connections with people ... but then again ... this is not the sole way of making connections ... and it's possible that existence of interconnected internet has made this 'bridge' lucrativity even more obsolete ... as one could simply invest in making an arbitrage bot and blow all the bridge people out of the water ... I mean in a sense that 'bridge' was some sort of 'gamble-pointing of a finger' when you were out of options ... and so you saw e.g. some ad in tel-aviv university sports club and thought: ha! this must be it! ... but it is very possible that for example working with parts and interrogating them with protector questions ... in retrospect ... wouldn't bring you to any 'bridge' seeking altogether. E.g. in a sense of: nothing's broke -- don't apply any sort of 'band-aid' on top of it ... it's like more like carrying some notion of 'if it's all so seemingly 'too calm'' then 'add even more overwhelm on top of it' -- 'and then it all will become clear!' sort of mindset .. which might in retrospect not overwhelm -- the already overwhelmed & mega-traumatised system.
[@ ^ 7.1.1.] ^^ When nobody talks ... there's not to 'bring yourself to people' to cause additional overwhelm on the system, that might in fact, be traumatised and needed more of that ramat aviv immersion ...

[@ ^ 8.1.] ^^ Blockchain & Crypto Technology books are probably '>' (bigger) in that domain-or-realm, than 'airdrop farming' ... (considering that plain 'indie-crypto lifetime narrative' is 'overwhelm' ...) 
[@ ^ 8.1.1.] ^^ In a sense that 'dry studying' of that technology somehow helps more than just plain farming/sybilling (although counter-intuitive (wtf does studying even help?!?!? (?)))) ...
[@ ^ 8.2.] ^^ Reading a substantial chunk of crypto-technology-or-blockchain-technology [<script name='book'>makeQuizElem2('Ym9vaw==','&lt;pomflh&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] before doing any faucets and/or airdrops? (?) (in a sense of 'which is higher elo level?' - wise)) -- you have staking already ... so ... 
[@ ^ 8.2.1.] ^^ What I'm trying to get to - is to do only minimalist super-obvious airdrop farming ... and like 2-3 precalculated steps (didn't need to jerky-signup for neither ampleforth, nor optimism, nor stargaze, nor evmos, nor aptos, nor paraswap, nor cowswap, etc.) ... jerky-signups definitely f*cks me up. And a 'book' before faucets could get me into an appropriate mood before jumping onto twitter? (?)
[@ ^ 9.] ^^ Is there such a thing as a 'dating elo rating' (as in r/datingoverfifty)? Or lack-of-dating-thereof elo-rating? In a sense that, m, it could be probably related to why ''indie-crypto lifetime narrative' elo rating' is an overwhelm, compared to 'cryptocurrency elo rating' ... ? (?) (?) (?)
[@ ^ 9.1.] ^^ Maybe it's just 'living around women' elo (without involving any sort of 'dating' or 'datingoverfifty' or 'lack-of-dating',, yet ...)
[@ ^ 10.] ^^ Is there ''indie-crypto lifetime narrative' elo rating' (aka. 'elo rating' pertaining to 'indie-crypto narrative') 
[@ ^ 10.1.] ^^ That is seemingly unfortunately is 'overwhelm' of some 'unknown kind' (when you had 8-9k$ - this was not an overwhelm) so unfortunately go back to 'cryptocurency elo rating' and dwell there? (?)

[>] Насчет соседей -- типа ты не знаешь что ты в состоянии 'beyond self-disciplining' или нет ... потому что (1) 'эмбодимент' зависит от визитирования такого-или-иного -- норзерн квартерса ('immigration precisely to ramat-aviv was a matter of luck') ... (х/з может потому что там все-еще возможна работа близкая к программированию (каким-то е*нным макаром х/з хотя может и эмбодимент там тоже скоро 'исчезнет' мы не можем этого знать ...) ... и (2) ты не знаешь -- когда (если вообще) ты сможешь в следующий раз туда приехать/доехать (вот так вот ...)

[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Point being, that if you have the 100$ money -- don't f*cking lose it ... do your utmost to not lose it. Money makes things easier. Whatever sh*t I'm in (or 'in for' ...)

[>] ^^ How I came to this section? [Try & Maintain existing] 'Katrain elo rating' (when lost & neurotic & cannot find yourself amidst 'floating in pink'/'pink brain'/'preagnant brain' .. ) ==> 'IFS elo rating' ==> 'Cults elo rating' (which is the same as 'ifs elo rating', right?) ==> 'Tai-chi/Martial Arts elo rating' ==> (resting day) ==> 'Bridge elo rating' ==> 'Cryptocurrency elo rating' ==> 'Indie-crypto elo rating' ==> '[Living with potenitally hostile] Women elo rating' ==> (When thinking of '[living with potentially hostile] women elo rating' then it f*cking backtracks to the 'hah, prove yourself!' aka 'the real katrain elo rating maintenance-of' ...

[>] One point of note, is, that 'boundaries between men' always exist, even on the topmost levels (e.g. 2 topmost competing presidents) so when really lost ... then you're really lost ... ==> This is less important ... the narrative is more about 'chess/baduk' helping me within nadine's group and henceforth ==> maintaining at least the same elo with katrain ... this way it's less 'sharp' in 'extreme states' (tbd1,,)

[@ ^ 5.] [WRITING_OWN_BADUK_KATAGO_LIKE_ENGINE_1] Writing own katago-like engine ==> and publishing it on github ... from scratch ... -- might borderline-help me study baduk as a-by-process and maintain my 'elo' at somewhat 'decent' level otherwise I just would not be able to write a decent engine.

[@ ^ 15.] [TALKING_ABOUT_KATRAIN_1] ^^ Telling to others about katrain might f*ck up your katrain elo rating, just like it did with chess ...
[@ ^ 15.1.] ^^ Sometimes getting outside of the 'feminism nonsense domination realm' (aka. home) into other gps locations could help, but needs self-organisation abilities like throw over-accumulated garbage, which, just doesn't happen.

[@ ^ 1.] ^ Sometimes a pc can capture my whole cross-board dragon - how is that ever possible? ==> Yeah, it's possible to surround a cross-board dragon ... just tried this myself with katrain human-human 9x9 board -- it's just like surrounding a side non-two-eyes-bunch of stones from 3 sides (because 4th side is off-board) ...

[#] Misc Notes - What comes after 'print 5+5' 

[>] So basically you're writing on paper your thoughts, and then there's a voice: 'write 'print 5+5'' ... so what do I do then? And does it really matter?
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Again, in a sense, it looks like the right direction here is to get tho fock out of the house due to 'r/MenGetRapedToo' dynamic that is definitely manifesting here ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ But let's say that you can't get outside due to some unforseen circumstance (something in the house needs to be fixed urgently or you're waiting urgently for someone, or there's some unforseen other circumstance e.g. you were in distress ... so you started writing your thougths on paper ... then a thought 'write me 'print 5+5' came', but when now you think about getting out -- the distress aren't 'gone' ... you're still in 'write thoughts on paper mode' and 'stuckness' whom you're trying to write onto paper - says: nope, not getting out!' ... -- so what do you do then? (In a sense of a 'print 5+5' thought?)
[>>> 1.1.1.1.] ^^ Because such situations did occur more than once to me.

[@ ^ 1.] ^^ So how do I 'continue' on that 'print 5+5' narrative? Let's say after few 'print 5+5''s in python repl prompt, you would next would want to probably write homebrew/weekend projects 'whatever you feel like' because 'disruptive technologies' and 'people are slowly 'catching up'' (aka. 'I'm having a fridge but everyone else have to go to the store and buy ice cubes' analogy) 
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ And henceforth it's important to rely on 'whatever you feel like' intuition because you innately feel where people might be 'slowly catching up'
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ Minecraft sign 32 bit is also a 'disruptive technology' and 'people are slowly catching up'

[@ ^ 2.] ^^ Next, you go into lesser-shitstorm indie crypto projects one of such would be a 'gmx.io' fork, that would allow for leverage trading practice mode, and would stop you from at least 'investing money into sh*tcoins' and _keep_ that 100$ in bitcoin for the sake of that document ...
[@ ^ 2.1.] ^^ Maybe also get into arbitrage bots ...
[@ ^ 2.2.] ^^ Also nano burn script might, m, be one of 'lesser-shitstorm' indie crypto projects (where is their medium doc)?
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Where 'homebrew' is not enough -- pummel them with 'crypto $$$$' ...

[@ ^ 3.] ^^ Worst case you go onto 'more shitstormish' indie crypt projects such as your own governatic chain, your own brown dust clone, tbd1,,
[@ ^ 3.1.] ^^ Your own decentralised datahoarder-services-for-money marketplace ... (?),, your own memrise clone for 'nft's',, your own 'Decentralised Coin Storage' minimalist PoW blockchain ...,,
[@ ^ 3.1.] ^^ But that still is imo better then dancing around for amberdao.io liquidity ... and ...
[@ ^ 3.2.] ^^ DCS (Decentralised Coin Storage) PoW coin (which allows non-native coins, but doesn't allow swaps, etc.)

[@ ^ 4.] ^^ Sw Projects around IFS -- forum, memrise clone (for ifs studying),,

[@ ^ 5.] ^^ Last but not least - you want to do 'dip' into father and/or michael excercise, just because conversations with them might be inevitable, and you want to have some 'safety-net' to resort to (regardless of legal/cult-mind-control/favoxil issues that I might or might not be able to resolve) ...

Onwards, Onto the finer detail (there are more finer subdivisions of 'homebrew', such as 'making order in filesystem' (in super-distress states)):

[@ ^ 1.] First of all you have to address the 'r/MenGetRapedToo' dynamic that is in the appartment building (otherwise you will get into 'paralyzis by analysis' mode without understanding what is going on ...
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ The subreddit has a list of books ... but the obvious first book is aflsd aka. 'Innocence Project' book and only then comes the 'Anatomy of Female Power' (?)
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ Secondly you have to somehow address the 'r/nofap' dynamic (because most likely you are sitting near the computer right now)
[@ ^ 1.1.1.1.] Also, you have to somehow address the 'r/datingoverfifty' dynamic ... 

[@ ^ 2.] ^^ Secondly you have to somehow address the 'r/nofap' dynamic (because most likely you are sitting near the computer right now)
[@ ^ 2.1.] ^^ 'Games complexity' & 'Shogi/Xiangqi' books right thereafter. Don't ask.

[@ ^ 3.] ^^ 'Human Depth Games complexity' books (don't ask) (see above).

[@ ^ 4.] Nosurf books.

[@ ^ 5.] Blockchain technologies books (first, second, and third reading is without any experiments, just read (for the sake of 'explosiveness'))

[@ ^ 6.] r/MenGetRapedToo - Chapter 2 ==> The 'what ifs cornered' states ... (where 'nothing works' aka even having done the tai-chi -- you cannot hyper-focus on j*ck sh*t)
[@ ^ 6.1.] ^^ Any 'female power' books you can find (not to 'debate' with women their 'female power' but to guide yourself (hopefully) out of that 'what-ifs-cornered' state) ...
[@ ^ 6.1.1.] ^^ Again, academic books on female power are probably more preferable because they are 'deeper' but also 'cults books' (because non-academic books sometimes get you into other 'sh*thole's).

[@ ^ 7.] Cults books (if reading 'female power' books for some other reason mentioned above).

[@ ^ 8.] Extreme Privacy && Identity Theft books (afraid of 'computer security' abyss)

[@ ^ 9.] ^^ How to pass exams books (studying chess is 'reading book' + 'puzzles'/'katrain' but then this also starts feeling relevant ...) 

tbd1,,

[@ ^ 4.] Poverty finance books (david ramsey?)

[@ ^ 8.] ^^ IFS Certification books help me talk to myself more coherently without being ashamed.
[@ ^ 8.1.] ^^ But 'voices' tell me that something should come 'before' those 'ifs books' ... (is it 'programming career' books?)

[>] Regular User: A user that connected his wallet to the platform and did one transaction (e.g. swap). ==> This definitely is significant and decreases the chance of 'missing out on that airdrop' due to occurences of e.g. { 'aptos', 'uniswap' (2021), 'ampleforth' (2021),, tbd1 }

[@ ^ 3.] 'Daytrading and leverage trading'

[>] [INDIE_CRYPTO_NARRATIVE_1] 'Indie crypto narrative' for 'bonding leverage' for 'lipton tea' is always preferable to 'airdrop farming' for that same leverage ... you have staking coins and beyond that there are 2-3 significant airdrops per year -- jerkiness-hunting for last-minute opportunities is very very hazardous. If they pressure you with time - super hazardous.
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Not being afraid of [missing] some earning opportunities that end in two weeks if you don't 'hurry hurry hurry' ... you have staking coins.

[>] [INDIE_CRYPTO_NARRATIVE_1] Indie-crypto lifetime narrative (micro-steps / incremental-micro-pilots) is better for trauma regulation then 'airdrop beggarship' narrative, because when you're a 'loser' and 'neighbors knock' then 'indie crypto narrative' 'survives' better then 'f*ck it no more airdrops' narrative (in that sense I mean ...) 
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ But again, it's not as 'palpatable' as 'almost-feels-like-real money' which is in 'airdrop hunter' narrative ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ This doc, for one, wouldn't be as 'findable' if not for 'airdrop farming' or '1 cent a year' narrative ...

[>] [COMPLETION_STATUS_COLUMN_1] 2-3 major airdrops per year ... типа когда-то ты понимаешь что по статистике когда ты заработал 1k$-2k$-3k$ то когда тебе раз-в-год прийдет _может быть_ eще 1k$-2k$ (и/или с _большой_ редкостью - 4k$-20k$ -- что нехрена не обещанно и можно так 10 лет прождать и нехера такого больше не будет никогда) то типа понимаешь -- что время которое ты вкладываешь в это - оно становится все более и более бессмысленно и не стоит того - стоит просто сидеть как йог и медитировать -- и психику и так уже досконально до невозможности фрагментированную - не нарушать (хотя-бы этими дерганиями-идиотствами). Вообщем что Я хочу -- чтобы скажем выбрать 'нашумевший' пройект скажем какой-то L1 ... и обозначать ему 'комплетенесс-статус' типа вот типа Я сделал здесь 10 транзакций в течение 3-4 недель на одном кошельке -- заминтил нфт -- проголосовал за один говернанс пропозал -- может зделал гиткоин донейшн -- дискорд привязал к этому аккаунту -- и в основном теперь там комплишн статус он примерно 80% и вообще его больше не трогаем нахуй. Дропнет-дропнет ... не дропнет-не дропнет. Типа писать колоночку: комплишн статус.

[>] [EVMOS_STAKING_1] Evmos staking is only there to have 1$/week to invest into top-ten hinted/confirmed token projects. But don't expect from it astronomic returns. Otherwise it's trading. We are de-facto counting on $EVMOS not to go below 0.7$ (like polygon/matic, which is also a evm) (which is based on speculation) ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Beyond that ... we don't 'invest' into evmos. For like 1000$/month returns we know it's sh*t. Should evmos die/go below 0.7$ then probably find some other 100% blockchain and/or even if we could accumulate a big sum till then (e.g. 1000$ just invest it into some 20% cosmos token or other L1 token (not a protocol))

[>] Q. Daytrading bitcoin: Bitcoin is probably the safest place to store airdropped & mined $$$ (due to 'less rugpullable smart contracts possbilities' and 'less human factor') but still is not the 'main unit of account' ... in a sense that you can ask 'how do you know that bitcoin doesn't go down now to 200$ per bitcoin?' when daytrading bitcoin, but you can't ask the inverse about usdc-to-bitcoin ratio when daytrading usdc.

[@ ^ 2.] A1.1.: ^^ In regard to 'bonding $$$' for 'gathering crates' ==> Immigration to ramat aviv was a matter of luck.

[>] You're going to lose access to this document again (b/c lose 100$ btc via amplified 100x loss factor) ...

[>] ^^ Remember you can't invest into crypto from outside sources!!! Daytrading you get 'liquidated' and then again 'liquidated' and then again you'll invest the last 100$ from bitcoin into there ... and then what? This document then becomes an ordinary document in filesystem again!

[>] [ANATOLYS_MORTAGE_DUE_1] ^^ Anatoly Yakovenko may have some mortage payouts left ... so he'll sporaidically sell at random times to not be 'too visible' but you ... are thinking ... wow, exciting technology ... so undervalued! Wtf -- ... and yakovenko ... ok ... I need here some mortage to pay ... hmm.

[>] ^^ You'll last longer (I understand that sometimes you don't want that, but in a good sense ...) if you just keep investing 3$/week for airdrops lottery.
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ You depend on every piece of crypto (even $200 is good. $400 is better. $800 is even better. 10x losses are terrifying.)

[>] [GAMBLER_BIAS_1] The reason leverage trading probably won't work in the longer term -- is because of 'human psychology' aka. the 'gambler bias' ('I'm always right! I can't be wrong! Just look at all the successful trades I've made in the past!... I just can't be wrong! ==> Invest more. ==> There's no 'lower bound' to the money you can and will invest. Or is there?).

[>] [NO_LOWER_BOUND_1] No lower bound (aka. where do you stop your losses)? At $100 loss? At $200 loss? Every $ in crypto is an important bonding leverage.

[>] Women: In a sense that if you say that 'bla bla being in a cult for 35 years and denouncing david miscavige of his kind' later on is also a shitty living and 'least bad trajectory' could be still to 'keep hanging' like this then after some time of watching a cult video/podcast an impending doom arises that, m, the women/dudayev issue is unadressed in this, m, so-called 'least bad trajectory' state -- and it is yes sharp and it will yes keep resurfacing ... to the extent that it will 'break me' and not enough to think 'aaa, people in cults even gave birth because the leader just told them so' and then 'treated their children like unrelated objects' ... and it will still most likely will 'break' me ... like, wtf ... in 'wtf, I'm not normal' sense ... so f*ck that -- still going to david miscavige like cult and fack ya all ya scamma!
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ So in that sense the 'strengthener' might be to yes watch 'mra documentaries' and podcasts and get 'late age' context from there too (not only from 'cults documentaries' ...) as that also could help me friction that 'f*ck this all - still need a cult here even though they warned agains those' ... e.g. maybe siphon even more context of 'how people were miserable with women' to 'stabilise' the dick instincts ...

[>] ^^ Basically on one hand: you know, or at least the 'photogenic' younger you - knew -- that 'it all comes down to force no shit and there's no way you're gonna convince me otherwise' ... and henceforth martial arts are completely legit, and worth to die for rather than skip a bjj class.
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ On the other hand, you've said: wtf those martial arts are worse than prison ... even after prison some people get out perfectly photogenic! And this!?!?!? -- Look what this one did to me!?!?!?!
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ But again ... on the very low level gut level -- you still feel that, umm, martial arts are still 'valid' even after a horrific aesthetic injury that some crazy (or hostile) guy in there did to you ... so you're trying 'not to lose' the martial arts narrative 'entirely' and even though tai-chi could be by many accounts considered a laughable form of martial arts by many ... self-rehearsed chin-na is better than no-chin-na at all (or something along these lines)

[>] Martial arts that are done entirely in your head - is a 'mental masturbation' so I suppose some sort of 'dance meditation' with some random not-necessarily-effective martial moves mimicking - if you could do it every (or almost every day) -- you could at least say: 'I [<script name="tried my best">makeQuizElem2('dHJpZWQgbXkgYmVzdA==','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] not to lose martial arts narrative' compared to if you just done them in your head. 
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Because again, the 'it all comes down to force no shit and there's no way you're gonna convince me otherwise' frame still makes at least _some_ sense ... I 'sense' it every f*cking day in some certain gps locations especially ... those subtle, hidden, but definitely 'sensed' 'power plays' ... and even though the format of 'thrill-driven rolling with few partners every week' format - is overwhelming or even would, if properly researched, turn out to be medically incorrect, in a sense that 'thrill' perhaps should not be mixed into a weekly training due to burnouts and injuries (like the one that I had with some fractured bone) 
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ even though the format might turn out to be not correct for all populations -- until it is 'corrected' and such form of 'trauma-aware martial art' would be prominent all over the world and 5-10 clubs in tel aviv would open (like there's now with bjj) ... -- until then I at least do tai-chi kata as to not to lose martial arts narrative entirely ... 'лучше синица в руке чем журавль в небе' итп ...
[>>> 1.1.1.1.] ^^ I wouldn't be the one to do it because - or who knows -- but at least do a f*cking tai-chi excercise daily you can do (and smoking) -- so first pls establish a consistent tai-chi regular activity (without smoking) -- and then and only then you could worry about 'opening your own trauma aware dojo' (but if you start smoking once again -- then close theere fokkr dojo again) ...

To Recap:
[>] Q. Why just copy-catting jwing ming chin-na books and dvd's into your head - is not enough and you should do some stupid tai-chi kata? ==> 'Don't lose martial arts entirely' narrative is not kept then, if it's all done in your head .. e.g. if you assume that, m, a laptop/pc is an 'extension of human brain' ...  
[>] Q. Why immediately jumping to watching bjj seminar vids and/or even reading bjj book every day - after you sense coercive violence all around -- is probably not such a good idea? ==> A1: 'Shame-induced self-harm' ==> 'Как ты смеешь вообще с таким лицом наружу показываться, ты [<script name="урод несусветный">makeQuizElem2('0YPRgNC+0LQg0L3QtdGB0YPRgdCy0LXRgtC90YvQuQ==','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] !?!?!' ==> Иногда у меня бывают такие 'эпизодики' с самим собой (!!) и иногда они доходят до само-брутальностей над собой (!!) ...

[#] Studying Yulia Varlakova's ifs polarisation resolving excercise for what-if-cornered states during the day (and comparing it to stephane/dangeli etc.) ...

[>] ^^ Youtube: 8shZvkxyAyY

[>] Q. What will happen if I talk about this excercise to the police (like I'd want to do with stephane)? ==> ?
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ What's the 'underlying dynamic that is involved here'? ==> That I cannot study 'situational stuckness' 'polarisation resolving' excercises of any kind whatsoever? Or what? (?)
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ How does that yulia's polarisation resolving excercise relate to 'no-bad-parts frame rupture'?

[>] [CRAWL_TOWARDS_IFS_THERAPISTS_1] Q. How does yulia's excercise relate to 'crawling towards ifs therapists'? ==> Still can't beat 'evidence-flipping' 'socially proofed' shuhrik!
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ With all that said, still hunting airdrops for 100$ in bitcoin for the purpose of finding this document ... - is overwhelming information activity and just focusing on 'varlakova' excercise && 'shuhrik' is not enough? (?) (unless you believe that bitcoin won't go into 0.00001$ never? (?)) ==> For expansion see below: 'Yulia Varlakova excercise and '100$ in bitcoin' information overwhelm'

[>] [100_IN_BITCOIN_1] Yulia Varlakova excercise and '100$ in bitcoin' information overwhelm ==> We said, that for this document to 'hold' -- we need 100$ in bitcoin ... and so we're still hunting airdrops (or should we?) I mean the probability is very low that I won't have 100$ in bitcoin in the next 10-20 years. Are we addressing that problem properly (e.g. via hunting new airdrops?)
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Common sense point 1: So generally you shouldn't invest more than ~20-30 minutes a day into new airdrop hunting, with the premise that I have enough money now to sustain 100$ bitcoin for next 10 years for sake of this document.
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ But there's limitless 'bonding leverage' problem! E.g. there's never enough 'bonding leverage' ==> You will most likely not attain this bonding leverage by airdrop-hunting for 8+ hours a day since this is an overwhelming, burnout-ish, and menual task (which has many chinese-farmers competitors) -- aka the 'investments-vs-results' problem.
[@ ^ 1.2.] ^^ With that said, if you were 'compulsively' on twitter today for 20-30 minutes already -- then supposedly today you have 'farmed' 'enough' (?) (and it's like, that, more 'organisedness' needs to be 'breathed in' (again, unless it's somewhat emergency, USDC crashed and you had to swap all wallets to dai).

[>] Varlakova excercise and 'hole in IFS'
[@ ^ 1.] If you have both 'No Bad Parts Frame rupture' _and_ 'you have no sugardaddy or a money for ifs therapist' ==> Then it's a 'hole' in 'ifs model'
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ It is a 'bad' hole (remember r/MenGetRapedToo?) in a sense that it introduces 'instability' and most likely 'unexpected bad (or bald (had to write the 'bald' here for some reason ...) surprises'
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ One ultra-superficial solution to this is study both {{ 'mozaic mind' (aka. 'ifs certification' books } and { 'smart contracts' / 'ida pro' / 'reactos' / 'programming methodology that separates me from a 12 year old smart contract developer' books } } ... 
[@ ^ 1.1.1.1.] If it's just a 'mozaic mind' then it's 1000 more broken tooth ahead (because you 'jumped trains at full speed' / 'do not stop something that works until something better came along' proverbs etc.) 
[@ ^ 1.1.1.1.1.] ^^ From the varlakova perspective though, it makes 'varlakova' excercise much more important because it can be done even when bankrupt. (It is ifs-approved (and academically peer-reviewed --> 500 ifs therapists will 'accept' (?) that excercise ...)
[@ ^ 1.1.1.2.] In regard to programming ==> programming has a 'stuckness point' at 'r/MenGetRapedToo' (and possibly 'r/nofap')

[>] [TAI_CHI_1] Varlakova excercise and tai-chi kata (after 6PM)
[@ ^ 1.] ^ It's very difficult (?) to prove the existence of 'forceful coercion' (or to 'deduce' 'forceful coercion' from perpetual knockors' noise -- some [ifs] part just says - 'no - I don't agree that it's a 'coercion' ...' ...) ==> So can't 'deduce' 'not abandoning martial arts narrative entirely' strictly from knocko-couch-draggers unfortunately (whilst respecting ifs principle of 'no bad parts') ... ==> ?
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^ [It was erased, but] you could without 'going directly against knockos' say that I get weird 'I enjoy rape in prison' states, (in certain, specific gps locations) ==> and then, should due to some weird perversiveness, things arrive to a real rape in prison scenario ==> arrive to that prison's rapist, knowing some chin-na (when facing that prison rapist) ... because I might not like it when he literaly starts touching my body (even though I desired it earlier) ... so I have at least some, m, 'safety net'/'kill switch' (so to speak) .. 
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^ After all If I read from r/MenGetRapedToo ==> There are some topics { "Does anyone else feel filthy and need to shower constantly?",, "I keep setting myself up for assault",, (tbd1) } which don't seem to be describing 'pleasureable'/'enjoyable'/'desireable' states at all ==> those topics do not look sympathetic at all!
[@ ^ 1.1.1.1.] ^ Dance Element of Tai-chi: It _feels_ like, martial arts that are totally 'in your head' - do still implicate that you have yes 'given up entirely on martial arts narrative' ... so memorising chin-na books only is not enough (if 'books only' then it sort of implies that 'yes given on martial arts narrative entirely') ==> so there has to be at least some 'out-of-your-head-only' activity adjacent to it ... ==> So far tai-chi aka 'dancing out martial arts moves in a 'wishwashy' way' fits the bill. It doesn't mean though, that after those 'wish-washy' moves, you want to stop and not pursue further the real studying of a more 'precise' (and not a 'wish-washy') versions of martial arts chin-na and ground chin-na maneuvers (now, that it's not 'entirely in your head' (for that day, after tai-chi that was done during that day, ...)) ...
[@ ^ 1.1.1.1.1.] ^^ But again, if you feel burned out enough from tai-chi alone ... then fack ya fack ya fack ya -- at least let it be tai-chi alone ... (and not a total 'abandon of martial arts subject entirely whatsoever' ...) ...
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ Since varlakova's excercise resembles stephane closely ==> 'Stephane Ball won't open / Protector won't step aside' (and on the other hand 'IFS therapists' have 'ban' - so at least to keep & maintain self-ifs option (need 'safety' for 'stephane ball to open' (and to sh*t up about stephane even for a second prison term)) ...
[@ ^ 3.] ^^ I wrote already that I 'enjoy' rape in prison, but there's one thing that I still do not enjoy, and that is 'ifs therapists ban' vs. 'sleep doctor's final verdict incoherence' (even though it's 'looking too long into an abyss' and 'sleep doctor' shouldn't be involved never) ... but nevertheless ... then at least I can say when '100x leverage trading' ... that 'I will end up 'in-between-chairs' in regard to { 'ifs therapists ban' vs. 'sleep doctor's final verdict incoherence' } ... if I keep { 100x leverage trading like that } ...' but again the connection is not fully apparent (tbd1,,)
[@ ^ 3.1.] ^^ So anyway the relation of tai-chi kata && chess to { ifs therapists } is that 'ifs is a cult' and with cult leader you deal via { 'playing chess with cult leader' && 'doing martial arts vs cult leader' (aka . not abandoning martial arts narrative entirely ...) } ... so henceforth a tai-chi connection to { 'some discernable activity that I do not 'enjoy' (like I for 'rape in prison' would ...) and 'want to avoid' } ... (?)
[@ ^ 4.] Toxic Shame is academically recognised as a toxic phenomenon (see internalguides.net) and sometimes fighting toxic shame requires 'manifesting non-comformism' (yelling in weird places, dressing sometimes inappropriately, etc.) ... and non-comformists are going to be 'pecked on' (remember that parenting.stackexchange.com post?) -- if you are not confident enough in your ability to 'back' 'non-comformism' (martial arts) then there's inability to manifest noncomformism which things get 'accumulated' inside to the extent that 1000 depot shots won't help.
[@ ^ 4.1.] ^^ So basically: 'Childhood trauma' ==> 'Toxic Shame' ==> Need 'nonconformism' (aka. yelling 'freedom' 'way too more often for the police's taste') to 'plow through' that toxic shame (or otherwise things will get 'clogged up' and no depot shots will help) ==> Noncomformists will be always, always pecked at (tbd1, https://parenting.stackexchange.com/questions/21393/impact-on-kids-not-having-tv (*1)) ==> Bjj & tai-chi & shibashi to 'back up' my 'non-comformisms' ('wtf ya')
[@ ^ 4.1.1.] (*1) "I think the question can be generalized to any form of non-conformism. People not fitting into the so-called "norm" will always be picked-on by some others, if not because of the TV? it will be clothes, music or simply physical difference. So it would basically depend on how far are you ready to go with "non-conformism" and how you would deal with possible problems happening..."
[@ ^ 4.1.2.] ^^ You end up like mr. fredricksen but at least less hospitalizations (?)
[@ ^ 5.] There is a 'hole' in 'IFS' in a sense that, m, when you have 'no bad parts frame rupture' and also 'are bankrupt' ... you can't m, just go to 'ifs therapist' or possibly even zoom chat on the cellphone (because you have no cellphone) ... and then you have to work on some menial job to get that cellphone and internet connection ... and in menial jobs there is a lot of 'autorative power abuse' ... and that's where 'martial arts' (or memorised bjj (worst case trust some book written by some bjj sparring champion)) become very important ...
[@ ^ 5.1.] ^^ Maybe also here need to self-study 'how to pass exams' book by dominic obrien because that whole 'studying via 1000 repetitions' vs. 'studying via memory palace pegging system' is a one huge 'burnout and overwhelm' headf*ckery and want 'optimal result here' in a sense that I have in my head most of bjj & chin na books contents without as much headfuckery as possible (maybe actually '1000 repetitions over time' will cause greater 'most bjj & chin-na' books in my head then indulging in 'how to pass exams' headf*ckery in the first place) ...
[@ ^ 5.1.1.] ^^ But memorisation systems sometimes (at some 'situational moments') seem *super, super* important and as if it's a 'deal breaker' without them. So welcome to the new headf*ckery realm! (But for now just do the 'base-touching'/'palpating' distress books (?) [2022.11.25]).

[>] Varlakova excercise and tai-chi incoherence (you're doing it but not re-watching or re-reading it)
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Worst case, read fiction book (tbd1,,)
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ Copy-cat random comparing between own summarised (own prepared 'images with red arrows designating movement directions' summaries) material, and 'book' (e.g. over-the-days checks, whilst labeling: '[last-date-check: 2022.02.02]' as goes with 'distress books' right now ...)
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ The assumption is that own summaries are better than videos (because it's at least scrollable pdf with a more-readily-searchable content than videos) ...
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Today skipping,, no crypto,, [2022.11.25]

[>] [GAMES_1] Varlakova excercise and playing any games whatsoever (even the more-trollable ones) after 6 PM ==> ?
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Since in some certain gps locations the discernance between 'prison' and 'freedom' is lost, the only discernance that is left is { 'ifs therapists ban' vs. 'sleep doctor's final verdict incoherence' } aka it is the only one thing that I don't 'enjoy' (as compared to 'rape in prison', which I do 'enjoy' in those gps locations) ... and henceforth and but yet then since it is the discernance ... this means than then I'm automatically in the 'cult' of 'ifs therapists' and hence I should 'play chess (or even more trollable games?)' with 'cult leader' to not get to situation whereas I'm submitted into that cult further and further ... and supposedly 'more/less trollable games' are better than 'no games at all! (!!)' e.g. what I mean by that is that I should either play in my mind with either 'nadine lucas' and/or with 'akiva/keith wolff' (and/or with Osnat Arbel and/or with Einat Bronstein) in my mind ... (?)

[>] [PAPER_1] Varlakova excercise and longhand paper ... 
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Statistics on paper vs. 'statistics in the head' (aka. 'iterative probabilistic reasoning' (which is done 'over the days') will just not work without a 'recording' medium of some sort or you'll 'forget' what you 'thought' yestreday ...) (that's one example of 'wtf paper') ...

[>] [PAPER_1] Varlakova excercise and disposing of longhand paper ...
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ So how do I connect the 'disposing' of longhand paper to 'the only thing that I can discern as non-enjoyable' aka. { 'ifs therapists landscape ban' vs. 'sleep doctor final verdict incoherence' }
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ Longhand Paper disposal starts with computer organisedness (sysadmin and making order in filesystem ...) ...


[>] Varlakova excercise and 'mantuba' books ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ After 6PM must also add 'mantuba' books to repertoire of distress books (tbd1,,)

[>] [00:01:22:00] ^^ "Xочу сказать что возможно у вас это упражнение сразу полу получится сделать полностью легко и все пройдет гладко ... возможно что вы сделаете только часть этого упражнения и это абсолютно нормально ... это абсолютно не означает что вы потерпели провал ... но это лишь означают что возможно вам нужно больше времени чтобы лучше понять свои противоречия своей части внутри вас и это абсолютно нормально потому что иногда нашим частям нужно больше времени чтобы они доверяли[сь] нам и были способны к нашему внутреннему диалогу и чем серьезнее ситуация тем больше мы можем ощущать эти внутренние противоречия и тогда возможно понадобится чуть больше времени ...

[>] Что изменяется вечером по сравнению с днем? ==> После тай-чи каты меня 'выкидывает наружу' и днем чтобы выкинуло - это 'логистическая проблемма' потому что, м, днем вокруг все 'забито' а ночью можно хоть как-то раз в 24 часа 'приткнуться' хоть куда-нибудь и продохнуться ... после выполнения того-же самого тай-чи (если он еще вообще релевантен вообще, в режиме ползения к ифс-терапевту) ...

[#] IFS Summary (how well do I know IFS?) ...

Preamble:
[>] ^^ Ifs (if looking at it through 'maintaining the same level of katrain elo' ==> 'maintaining the same level of so-called-metaphorical 'ifs elo'') is a 'lesser bottomless pit' -- because it has no 'elo' really ... ===> But, it is really helpful in addressing panic states (and overwhelms and burnouts).

Areas that are rather known to me:

[>] Tbd1,,

Areas that are less known to me:
[>] Unburdening, retrieval -- just for academical sake (maybe not that important when doing self-ifs anyway) (But still).
[>] Jay Earley's 'Freedom From Inner Critic' book contents (e.g. 'criticised child'). ==> So there's yes stuff to learn (if I manage not to die from overdose beforehand).

<div hidden>tag: limits_problem_1,,</div>
[#] Misc Notes - Limits Problem

[>] This problem seems somehow important ... e.g. in a sense that when this problem 'escalates' to immense proportions -- it can 'drive you crazy' 

[>] Example of a limits problem: вот хотел закрыть окно на щелочку ... и типа начал долго 'раздумывать' а может еще немножко 'прикрыть'? ... а может еще немножко 'открыть'. ... а может все таки немножко прикрыть? ... а может всетаки теперь немножко приоткрыть? ... ==> И так можно до бесконечности -- если ты в каком-то там хреновом специфическом состоянии находишься ... to the extent that it can drive you to madness ...

[>] Severe limits problem is a sign of a [<script name='traumatized'>makeQuizElem2('dHJhdW1hdGl6ZWQ=','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] psyche ...

[>] Example: Another example of a limits problem: Choosing grocery at the store: this one I don't like ... this one I also don't like ... this one I also don't like ... and like cycling over seemingly identical products over some 'little thing' ... eventually sabotaging the whole grocery purchase and later feeling depressed because you couldn't buy and that was _so trivial_, _so trivial_! How could you not buy me this simple thing!?!?!

[#] Misc Notes - Grounding in books via podcasts & videos ...

[>] ^^ Sometimes I just can't f*cking _touch_ books e.g. cults books, even after watching hours on hours of podcasts -- which is some sort of a hidden indicator of some sort -- everything appears 'normal' on the surface ... but on the other hand I can watch podcasts for hours and still be unable to just touch a f*cking book!
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ So maybe this could be some sort of 'indicator' of how deep in twilight zone etc.. (unable to earn crypto don't know why etc.)

So what are some books that could help me 'palpate' where I am in the 'gloom' spectrum ==> so obviously cults books (e.g. find out where you stopped previously yesterday or a few days ago etc...) ... (?)

[@ ^ 1.] Fiction books -
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Sometimes I get a 'fog' of where I were with a fiction book ... ==> Just find where I am ...
[@ ^ 1.1.] Book: Leviathan wakes ... (both on flibusta and libgen,, goodreads finalist 2013). ==> tbd1,,

[@ ^ 2.] Bjj book - eventually I can't touch it because on the other hand the zygomatic photogenic face destruction was the, m, on the grade of 'ostrov' movie grade mistake -- that, like, an individual never, like never, gets forgiven for it. And the whole 'not giving up on martial arts entirely' problem (amidst sensing subtle 'power plays' (irregardless of whether I'm now photogenic or not) is NP-hard because of that 'ostrov' mistake ... so henceforth starting with some mild 'do not give up on martial arts entirely' type books and hoping that that one is 'chewable' so I don't 'self cut into little pieces' ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ As I've said, if you start with chin-na book it's also not good ... because if it's 'only in your head' then it kind of seems that you have yes given up on martial arts entirely if before practicing any 'moves' (even the barely resembling some functional moves) you say 'you did enough, enough enough -- don't touch don't touch don't touch' and eventually just read read read and don't practice sh*t ==> So here is probably is tai-chi book (where at least you 'dance out' some martial arts elements) is 'best bet' ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ Apparently with 'dancing out' 'martial moves' there's no 'don't touch don't touch don't touch' immediately firing before even starting ... but rather lets me finish the 'dance out' ... at least _something_ that is not _entirely in the head_ ... 
[@ ^ 2.1.] ^^ Still haven't figured this out yet ...

[@ ^ 3.] ...

[@ ^ 3.] Cults books
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Нету места мне в мире этом и по всему этому израилю миша меня опередил по всему израилю поверх и поперек. Не нахожу себе места в мире проклятом этом после того как сотворили надо мной что сотворили.
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Что бы Я не делал - как бы не извивлялся - мишин сын растет (и может еще там планируется ...) ... мщю ли Я -- помирился ли Я ... и не факт что у людей рождаются сыновья вообще -- после пяти дочерей итп ... 

[@ ^ 4.] Dating & Human-mating books (& grounding on them via mra documentaries and podcasts)
[@ ^ 4.1.] ^^ Иногда когда Я типа пребываю в состояниях что Я не вижу 'десяти-часовой стратегии вылеза' из состояния в котором Я сейчас нахожусь (типа один такой пример это когда в рестинг дей у тебя закрыт доступ к крипто-транзакзицям например (а так когда открыт доступ к таковым -- то вроде пока еще микро-апдейтс этого документа вместе там с сваппингом, ре-стейкингом, и говернанс-вотингом вроде пока 'держит' как 10-часовая стратегия вылеза из 'сумрачных состояний')) - то тогда в таких случаях может быть все-таки да прибегать и к таким мерам (по крайней мере это да работало 2022.11.06))
[@ ^ 4.1.1.] ^^ Рашионала она такая: (1) Что типа эирдроп хантинг - это хреновая, не-совсем-стабильная стратегия. (2) Индие-крипто лайфтайм нарратив - это более стабильная стратегия, но тут громадная пропасть которая 'всплывает' тогда -- что мне уже 44 почти и меня диким образом предала семья в том числе мой родной (!!) брат (!!) и так или иначе - половой орган есть и в нем так-же есть кровеносные сосуды. И так-или-иначе когда захочешь вернуться к 'более-стабильному программированию' (или учителю по программированию х/з) - то тогда так или иначе всплывает тема баб и позднего возраста.
[@ ^ 4.1.1.1.] ^^^ И поэтому - тогда чтобы заниматься тем-же самым 'нюхать' хоть как-то этот же самый 'более-стабильный' 'инди-крипто лайфтайм наррэйтиве' то нужно проходить через-эту-тему баб (что раскинь-или-прикинь несомненно травматично и несет с собой секондари эффектс само-по-себе).

[@ ^ 8.] Crypto technology books (tbd1)
[@ ^ 8.1.] ^^ Crypto that you don't talk about is a great 'psychological' and 'fragmented psyche' helper tool (think having a large 'bonding leverage' for 'lipton tea' -- does that affect 'psyche fragmentation' or not (in a sense of having a 'cohesive singular identity')?) ... so crypto technology books help in many ways for example how to store those money more safely ... in which blockchain? In which pow blockchain of all pow blockchains?   
[@ ^ 8.2.] ^^ In some days you can't do 'crypto transactions' ...
[@ ^ 8.3.] ^^ Bridge 3h punishment is a 'lesser bottomless pit' than more major cults out there but again a big bonding leverage can absolutely 'prolong' the '3h punishment' buffer ... in a sense that if '3h punishment is still not enough for you for self-accountability' then you could bond some secret sum of money if you have such sum ... and 'prolong that 3h punishment buffer' and thus come out as a yes 'accountable' person in society you reside in ...
[@ ^ 8.3.1.] ^^ Again without knowing the technology behind it ... crypto is a 'ghost city' for outside investors who just fomo into bitcoin and ethereum ... so you are with your current knowledge are alot like them compared to e.g. some smart contract and/or blockchain concensus dev who knows all concensus mechanisms and all smart contract langs and their 'buffer overflow' hack schemes that are more present in one smart contract language and less present in another ... it's like someone who doesn't do programming much won't know the need for typesafe programming and checking errors at compile time via more tighter contract programming versis less tight as c does it (it just says 'void*' parameter and idk what you pass to me therefore resulting in unforseen errors of 'programmer who forgot')
[@ ^ 8.5.] ^^ In a sense, 'indie-crypto lifetime narrative' elo is yes 'overwhelm' (of an 'unknown kind') whilst 'cryptocurrency elo rating' is not an overwhelm (?) ... and within 'cryptocurrency elo rating' ==> probably 'books' are bigger than ('>') 'farming' (e.g. are higher on 'elo rating') ...
[@ ^ 8.6.] ^^ Reason: Reading crypto technology books help with 'crypto [<script name='nosurf'>makeQuizElem2('bm9zdXJm','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] breach' aka the [<script name='r/nosurf'>makeQuizElem2('ci9ub3N1cmY=','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] hole that crypto [<script name='creates'>makeQuizElem2('Y3JlYXRlcw==','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] (additional lottery-chance 1000$ a year is not worth the r/nosurf hole breach).
[@ ^ 8.7.] ^^ Reason: Compared to 'crypto developer googler' - if you know sound fundamentals of many blockchains could have an edge, when you're amidst a 'coding war' and don't have much time for 'theory' just like knowledge of 'hennessy patterson' book could give an edge, hypothetically, compared to some non-knowledgeable integrity programmer (of the same 'photogenic rating') ... (just trying to come up with reasons here to battle madness of my life situation, sorry!)

[@ ^ 14.] CPTSD Books ('serial humilation')

[@ ^ 16.] DID books (is there a 'rock bottom'?) ...
[@ ^ 16.1.] ^^ Queued Videos for prewatch-grounding in books ==> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoI94Epkjrc,, 

[@ ^ 28.] Programming books are very powerful because the notion of 'the less code -- the more secure the money' -- you harvested from them (tha programming books) ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Whatever ... and how does that help me? That I should root in programming books? After watching programming documentaries? Memrise.com? Tm-srs? (?)

[>] Preamble: Q. What if I run out of books or movies on a cetain distress topic (e.g. women/mra)?
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ A1: I'm counting on endless stream of podcasts e.g. r/datingoverfifty themed and even from there I suppose you could harvest context for 'anti feminism legal self defense' in different shades and shapes.
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ Worst case re-read over-and-over (as if preparing to some 'eternal exam') via 1000 repetitions and spice it up with an endless stream of fiction books ...
[>>> 1.1.1.1.] ^^ In a sense, that, distress states are 1000x worse than 'ahh it's just sooo boring' states.

Q&A:
[>] Q. What are some examples of 'distress states'? (which I'm supposedly aiming to resolve via 'hmm,' 'distress books'?)
[>>> 1.1.] A1.1: Shame-induced self-harm polarisation (e.g. 'как ты смеешь показываться с таким лицом наружу вообще?') vs. 'coercion is 'felt' and is does require martial arts training' ..

[>] Q. How are ever books ever helpful with self-harm? ==> A1: Like with 'banano burn' on 'excessive content consumption' ...

Categories:

[>] ^ Cults Books ('beyond white worms' (when imagining that 'white worms' will eventually eat me below ground (a truism))

[>] ^ Women/MRA/LWMA/MenGetRapedToo books ('anti feminism legal self defense') books (living with powerful women in the same building)

[>] ^ CPTSD Books (as for building an excuse, at my fifties, for watching 20 yr/old PU lectures (then there's a f*cking abundance of them and not a shortage ...)) ==> It was f*cking childhood trauma wtf. (but on the flip-side I remain 'coherent') ...

[>] ^ DID Books

[>] ^ Crypto Technology books (sometimes 'crypto cryto voice just won't 'let go' ...)

[>] ^ Baduk book (find where you stopped yesterday (or 5 days ago (if was 'extreme' distress' ...)))

Not distress books (and why not):

[>] ^^ IFS Books - the point being - is if you just 'found' where you were yesterday .. and didn't really progress -- that doesn't mean that ifs stuff is not being internalized! This stuff takes (might take) long to digest ... 
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Sometimes a question pops up: 'Which one of ifs books?' ==> In distress states sometimes you have 'limits problem' so it's Jay Earley Ifs Therapy ==> No bad Parts (Schwartz) ==> Frank Anderson (his 'Therapists' book) ==> Second Edition IFS Therapy by Schwartz ==> All 3 tomes of earley ==> Do not change this, only over-the-days! 
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ IFS Book gives context to chess (via nadine lucas group) and making it 'lesser bottomless pit' in 'chess & katrain player's glasses' (but only if you have those 'glasses' (and you have those glasses by pure incidence from 'interacting' with 'nadine lucas group' ('why don't he ever talk?' / 'Is he spying on us'? && echoline && xyk))

[>] ^ Guitar and Piano books (need pc tweaking for that (?))

[>] [FICTION_BOOKS_1] Fiction books - if you 'feel bored' by author's verbal diarrhea - then write your own fiction novella ... or keep reading ... sometimes, in 'stuck' 'daytime' petah-tikva it's just so.

[>] Besides crypto-technology books .. probably also books that are related to 'distress coding around this very document' (some js/ts scripts that you wanted to write around this document, etc.)

Distress state transition (anomalies):

[>] Q. Sometimes I hear a voice 'tai-chi! tai-chi!' -- what do I do if I am in 'distress books' mode? How do I so-to-speak 'palpate' that 'ifs part' within that state? (Or should I just, m, 'let it yell and whateva!') ?
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ A1: Still, please remember that after 6PM till 4AM whether you've traveled to 'shore border' or you have not ... whether you've managed to not 'over-sleep' all that 6PM-4AM timespan (which happens sometimes too) ... that there's a slightly different 'distress books' mode for that time period which includes also (yeah, check below on that section, 'evening distress books',, tbd1)

[#] Misc Notes - Distress Books - Finding Your Place Within Books amidst Mental Fog -- Keeping Track ('books fasting')

Preamble section (or whatever it's called ...):

[>] ^^ 'Statistics on paper' vs. 'statistics in the head' ...

[>] ^^ Track where you _stopped_ yesterday within a specific book and/or 'book category' ... or is there a 'fog'?
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Even if you didn't progress -- remember the place/context of where you picked up 

[>] ^^ When you can't discern between 'prison' and 'freedom' and even more so don't care about { 'ifs therapists ban' vs. 'euthanasia doctor's final verdict' } (aka 'when' 'death' is involved .. then I don't know definitely it has to be 'dry books' 'fasting' when 'death'/'looking too long into abyss' is involved ...

[>] ^^ The idea for this came from / when driving to shore border ... and the premise is such: if you could only 'find' your place in Jay Earley's IFS book (or his 'freedom from inner critic' book) and didn't progress with reading at all --> This doesn't necessarily mean, that 'you are faulty' it might just mean that 'some ifs concept that you've read about earlier, is still being internalized and after 2-3 weeks or months, you 'll be able to 'progress' a paragraph or two or more ... -- and you just need to keep checking, to not forget about ifs/cptsd/did/sokal-hoax/william-kingdon-clifford narrative) ... 
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ During periods of 'overwhelm' & 'burnout' at least do not forget about 'narratives' via 'books' maybe overwhelm sometimes will recede and then you could progress again ...

[>] ^^ I think what keeps me to 'books' is that 'leverage trading practice mode on http://gains.trade ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Т.е. как та девочка которую 'насилуют' в деревне ... она 'хихикает' ну типа все 'классно, типа! а че!' .. а потом приходит домой -- входит в 'gains.trade' и говорит -- 'о, such a leverage-trading cheerleading friends I have ...' ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ So in a sense she doesn't, m, (r/mengetrapedtoo ('<cough>, <cough>, ;)')) understand on a 'surface level' that she is being abused .. but when she comes home -- she sees the 'results' on 'leverage trading shorts & long position & total balance' screen ... 

[>] ^^ Since there's 'information overload overwhelm' section in this document,, and 'crypto bonding leverage' is important to me .... ==> Hence this makes rationale for 'books fasting mode' .... (?)

(to remove the 'overly emotional' component (or whatever (?) (?) (?))) (tbd1,,)
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ When you lose in chess to someone, ask how much bitcoin was lost by losing to him in chess? If the answer is 'negative' or 'zero' probably it's because 'trust gaining' and ''ganging up' with somebody' property of chess is more important or is longer lasting positive effect that outweighs the negative effect of 'pain of loss' that lasts usually for few days or weeks (compared to 'benefits' of actually playing chess or other 'lesser-trollable game' with someone (because it's lesser-trollable game it probably means that he has nowhere to 'escape' but 'confide' in you a little more (no, he's not 'trolling' ... hence he is trustworthy person (or something (I mean in regard to the 'why it's zero bitcoin lost' (or even a 'negative sum is lost') when 'lost in chess'))) ...

[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Amount of googlings is somehow important.
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ On one hand you say 'every five year old kid nowadays is a programmer, theoretically speaking' but what if you took 12 year old kid to code you a smart contract for a new 'leverage trading dex' (e.g. some sort of gmx.io clone ...) -- would you trust him with his code as much as you would trust me (aka 30-37 year/old me) with my code? And what's the difference then?
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ Probably one answer is that in some books he presents a lot of use cases where he stretches the importance of extensive unit tests -- something that 5-12 year old kid would barely do. (And there are some other aspects that differentiate a '5-10 year old kid' from a 'trustowrthy smart contract dev' and though one of them - is software engineering methodologies books, and ability to pinpoint to a hirer-boss from which book you took this and that workflow/methodic).

'infinite virtual places' so you can then 'pivot' those 'tense social situations' more 'tolerably' while remaining 'still somewhat coherent'
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ So since 'coding minecraft' has to do with 'saving face' ==> You have to go 'very gently' with it by 'reading book' and taking it completely 'offline' ... (the webgl mc I mean)
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Current book: Joey De Vries 

[>] Minecraft Mc 1.12 modding tutorial (make a book of it) ==> [2022.11.22 11:50]

[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ Before you panic, remember that (1) Gains.trade might never switch off their 'practice mode. and (2) Resort to 'books' when things go 'too fast'
[@ ^ 1.2.] Fog areas (for books (sequental for now))
[@ ^ 1.2.2.] ^^ Smart contracts (solidity (both gmx.io and gains.trade use them)) ==> Seems still start with 'bitcoin book' or so it feels ...
[@ ^ 1.2.2.] ^^ React JS (https://github.com/gmx-io/gmx-interface has 'This project was bootstrapped with <a href="...">Create React App.</a>' so ...
[@ ^ 1.2.3.] ^^ Fog: how do they ever perform leverage ==> Imho, need to understand solidity first, for that (tbd1,,) (then skim their code without a debugger then from there probably conclusions for further books will arise) (but definitely reading 'smart contracts' book can 'decrease steepness' here) ...


Exotic book themes that do not serve a grounding purpose amidst potential did/cptsd trauma (so wtf are they here? ==> To know that such themes exist)

[>] Influence by Cialdini (e.g. 'Male Power') / 'Art Of War' by Sun Tzu 

[>] Cognitive Biases Books ('thinking fast and slow')

[>] Overview books about gaslighting/gaslighters ... 

Misc notes that are not necessarily related to books ==> To move them out of here into [dtao notes] please (after a day or two):

[>] Мысль: Это рахель кахана самэт убила тебя ... mother just mirrored for you what rachel kahana samet has done ... but there was something worse in the middle of the way ... ==> So again it's most likely hanan sagiv's mishandlance? 'Ата индивидуалист' ... Зе ло йикре леха ...

[>] ^^ So in a sense, rhetorics aside, people level or sheople level -- whoever interferes in some 'metaphysical way' to my earning (or keeping) 150 million $ in bitcoin -- is either an abuser or a gaslighter or ill-intentioned person (and 'bitcoin 150 million $' can serve as a 'detector' of hostile entities, whilst in 'gloom'/'twilight zone' ...) because I'm not hurting nobody in this f******* neighborhood by wanting to earn 150 million $ in bitcoin -- that's a honest non-people-harming goal ... and whoever stands on the way (on the metaphysical level, where you don't know how to really 'fight' and who 'won' and/or who 'lost' ... and everything is 'gloomy' and 'twilight-ish') ... is apparently an ill-intentioned entity (regardless of whether it's a parent or some stranger neighbor) (e.g. why the f*ck does it bother you that I want to have 150 million $ in bitcoin? (?) Does it 'itch' you in some way? Does it put some 'grain of sand' in your eye? What?)

[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ "I LOVE reframing these disorders as complex and even needed reactions to trauma, but I see a big problem in CPTSD communities ... I see a lot of black and white thinking, victim narrative, good vs bad, etc. [...] [torevise further, tbd1] [...] In the beginning, I thought CPTSD was the best diagnosis ever, because it stopped stigmatizing those with trauma and let the world know that it really wasn\u2019t our fault. But the longer I was stuck, the more I realized that the reason I loved it so much was it furthered reinforced the victim narrative in my head and that I was the \u201cgood guy\u201d while my abusers were \u201cbad guys.\u201d (I am not claiming anyone should forgive abusers. The healthiest thing imo would be to understand they are in the grey and view them with nuance, but still say they have no place in your life.) [...] This isn\u2019t fair, but it\u2019s the truth. It\u2019s why so many of us grapple with the abuse our parents places on us. Because we see that they were suffering, but that suffering does not negate toxicity. [...] I see a lot of people rejecting cluster b diagnoses and/or demonizing then. Those are OUR people. [...] It isn\u2019t fair, but if we want to heal we must take responsibility, accept who we are, and fight against this every day. It is not enough to reframe our experience with self love. We also must work on living with and loving others in healthy ways." [tbd1,,]

Jay Earley book has a note about 'opposite parts' [Chapter 5 ('becoming centered') ==> 'Other Ways To Unblend' ==> Finding an Opposed Part ==> (*1)]
[^ @ 1.] (*1) ^^ [Chapter 5 ('becoming centered') // 'Other Ways To Unblend' // Finding an Opposed Part ]  ==> """Look around inside for a part of you that is the opposite of the target part or a part that is in conflict with the target part. For example, Sheila might locate a part of her that wants harmony with her husband no matter what. [In addition to the part that is angry with her husband]. She would access that part and hear what it has to say. This would help her to realize that there is more to her than the Temper Tantrum Part. She would then find a place inside her that is neither the Temper Tantrum Part nor the Harmony Part. This is likely to be Self."""

[>] Q. Why being a president is a sh*tty job?
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ A1: Jokes are being made of you constantly (depressing).
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ A1.2: It's more a 'service' than it's a 'life' because every single tiny mis-step of yours is harshly judged by media 'he smiled inappropriately' ... 'he made such and such inappropriate' 'woke' comment ... he insulted gays here and here ... '5 soilders dead in iraq' (while it was not specifically president's fault)
[@ ^ 2.1.] ^^ Most likely you are going to be in trial after your service as a president because most surely you have pissed a huge chunk of population by then (without even doing sh*t).
[@ ^ 3.] ^^ They might later, after your term, introduce the 'cutting' of the budged of allotted security personnel for past, former ex-presidents (wtf not?) and later you will have no protection from super-pissed people who you pissed during your presidency term whilst this wasn't even directly your fault (but some of your subordinates f*ckup) ... and now it's you who 'serve as a target' ...

[>] Q. Why, even though being a president is a sh*tty job - one should want to aspire to be a president?
[@ ^ 1.] A1: Because if he was that much schizophrenic (or simply very damaged in his brain), or 'black swan' enough, so, that only 'noting down top-of-the-mountain' on paper could snap him out of those horrid 'pinkness' states ... then obviously taking on being a president and eating criticism from everybody and his mother is a better option than staying schizophrenic without ability to 'climb out' and 'lost and confused to oblivion' ...

[#] Misc Notes - Coding around this document - as a supposedly-distress activity 

Preamble:
[>] ^^ Sometimes perpetuals-trading still 'slips in' (and it happens f*cking impulsively! (e.g. yesterday 800$ with solana out-of-the-blue (and it was f*cking luck that I could get out of it ... it immediately went downslope immediately after)).

[>] ^^ Pay attention to 'distress books' as much as possible ...

[>] ^^ Off-shadow trading by 'coding' micro, but useless features around/for/about this document ... just for the sake of coding and steering off perpetuals leveraged trading. If I wrote some useless feature at least I 'killed time' and yet though not lost money like SBF (who leverage-traded FTT? (?))

[>] ^^ Remember that there's 'scripts/utils-staging.js' for in some states when you code, you sometimes get 'delayed' on some other 'perpetuals' screen when switching alt-tab ... 

[>] Leverage/derivatives trading or simply trading of any kind will definitely make 'programming in distress' impossible, because you will be compulsively switching to that trading screen, when switching alt-tab ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ And this document both relies on existence of $100 in bitcoin and also 'coding minecraft' (which was just made impossible, via leverage trading screen comulsive checking).

Warmups (considering its a distress):
[>] Making order in filesystem ...

[>] Reading js/ts books (because the coding is around this document, not 'reactos') ==> Not sure ... whether it will 'blow' or not ...

[>] Again, reminding here -- to read blockchain technology books. (?)

[>] Reminding: chess & baduk books ..

[>] Book: Shibashi book for, m, 'extremely noting' the 'shame-overdose-induced' 'self-harm'

[>] Getting back onto favoxil or at least ruminating about buying it (bridge just didn't 'fly' (for many reasons including 'Jay Wacker'))

[>] Throwing paper (and possibly into the water too) -- when you meet 'complex problems' (b/c 'programming puzzles' sometimes are more 'complex' then some menual, repetitive work such as 'do 5 repetitive swaps on 3 wallets') ==> You write them on paper ==> Sometimes personal stuff 'slips' in there too ... ==> So maybe would be useful to dispose of it from prying eyes.

[>] Book: Tai-chi book for 'not giving up entirely on martial arts narrative' ==> does it belong here or not?
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Like we said, with 'most-likely-corrupt-policemen-involved type of coercion' you could, m, easy talk about 'katrain' and then your 'maintaining same elo level with katrain goes: 'boom!' ...' ... ==> So there's obviously always is a rationale for 'not giving up entirely on martial arts narrative' (and there weren't for 'shame-overdose-induced self-harm' ....) ...

Trying to stay indifferent:

[>] So let's say they are checking their stiffledness every five minutes ... but you need to be either super-ultra rich to do that (so probably they have 'tons of money in monero')
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Maybe that way by assuming that no one knows how much money the other one got in monero, I could maintain a somewhat survivable boundary with them? (?)

[>] Представь что человек (какой-то душевный инвалид или пенсионер) сидит на стуле 24 часа у себя в квартире (или это женщина-инвалидка или пенсионер) и у него 'нервозный рефлекс такой' что он тихо сидит и вообще типа замкнутый такой почти ни с кем не разговаривает но раз в 1-2 минуты он просто обязан подвинуть стул на котором он сидит. Типа злиться на нервозные порывы такие или на людей которые вот в таком состоянии находятся -- бессмысленно. Типа че ты на него срывайся не срывайся он всеравно будет двигать стулом своим раз в 5 минут. Хоть ты его дубинкой поколоти. Всеравно он пока не умрет - будет продолжать раз в 5 минут двигать свой сидетельный стул. Побьешь его дубинкой -- он впадет в обморок -- очнется --- и всеравно через пять минут начнет опять двигать стул. И сага продолжается (?)

[>] [RAMAT_GAN_BNEY_BRAK_BOUNDARY_IF_1] Knocking neighbors do not drive with me to { 'bney-brak' <--> 'ramat-gan-boundary' } every day (so in that sense they are not the only culprit (in a sense of 'corrupt-police-involved-here' coercion.))

[>] [ABOVE_FIVE_SENSES_1] It is possible that some coercion that I'm feeling is beyond auditory/visual/olfactory/kinesthetic (not included here 'taste') - senses ... e.g. not 'knocks' nor anything I 'see' either ... it's just some sort of a 'gut feeling' but beyond auditory/visual/olfactory/kinesthetic senses ... that yes does 'coerce me' but not through something that I can see/hear/smell/sense-via-a-touch (I mean we're going off-grids here but, the point that I'm making is that sometimes when I'm getting mad at knockos -- I definitely had moments and 'ifs parts' saying to me -- that I did wrong by doing so (by reacting angrily onto them (in a sense that, m, if someone yells 'goat! goat!' and you 'react angrily to him' then you might not see the real goat later.)))

[>] [YOU_ARE_GONNA_LOSE_1] If you're fighting on a 'metaphysical level' most likely you are going to lose. Because the battle is not 'well-defined'. Where is loss? Where is a 'win'? ==> Sooo ==> you're gonna lose 99.999% (e.g. some example would be probably: 'interstellar shove into the abyss scene' (?) (I'm just speculating here, sorry...)).

[>] [TRAIN_TO_BUZAN_1] Knocking neighbors are 'psychotic women' (like in 'train to buzan' movie) ==> Yelling at them is like 'evil begets evil' ==> What would happen if he'd yell at that woman in 'train to buzan'? ==> That would just make her more furious ...

[@ ^ 1.] ^^ If something goes wrong (it did happen once - with 'ifs elo') -- go back / retract to 'maintaining the same elo level with katrain' - it still works ...
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Drawing - probably not (as there is very little 'competition context') ...
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ We need/want that for 'bjj & chin-na' spindown as seemingly just katrain/mom/civ/tetris-attack just don't seem to 'cut' it on their own alone-wise ...
[@ ^ 3.] ^^ It seems that tai-chi (aka. 'martial arts meditation' (as opposed to yoga, which is a 'postures' meditation)) is a 'part of' maintaining same elo level with 'bjj&chin-na'? E.g. 'do at least some 'farthest resemblance' movement? (?) (?) (?)
[@ ^ 3.1.] ^^ Or maybe I'm wrong? (?) (?) (?)
[@ ^ 3.1.1.] ^^ There's no 'maintaining the same elo level with tai-chi kata' because tai-chi is the actually one from which the whole idea of 'keeping _at least_ the same elo level with katrain' hyper-focus came from ... in a sense that it says ... 'at least don't lose martial arts at all if you have bjj painful fracture ... because martial arts are _so_, _so_ important' and 'probably self-rehearsed 'mostly theoretical only' chin-na is better than no chin-na knowledge altogether, even theoretical' from that 'at least don't lose martial arts entirely' probably came the understanding: 'don't lose katrain entirely' ... ==> so supposedly copy-catting chin-na as per jwing ming's books & dvd's (you have both, also for martial applications of it) supposed to 'keep' that 'elo' 'hyper-focus' ==> So I suppose what it should be is: 'copy-catting chin-na and it's martial applications as perfectly as possible' and the best you can make of it ==> Try 'trembling' for it ... who knows ... ==> tbd1,,
[@ ^ 4.] [IFS_1] ^^ Is there 'maintaining the same ELO' with ifs? ==> Seems like not so it means that ifs is a 'bottomless pit' yet in some certain situational overwhelm situations it is very useful... and there are a lot of overwhelming situational situations in certain specific GPS locations ... ==> tbd1,,
[@ ^ 4.1.] ^^ Also: ifs is not a bottomless pit in a sense that if a specific individual is in some cult (or jumping between cults) ... then ifs provides an 'academically-refined' cult which is a 'less' 'bottomless pit' than some other 'cults' that exist out there ... due to 'academia-peer-review' property of it ...,, but still tbd1
[@ ^ 4.1.1.] ^^ So in a sense ifs is not a 'bottomless pit' but rather is a 'lesser' 'bottomless pit' which is good for segments of population who reside in a 'bottomless pit' (e.g. cults followers who do not realise and/or blackout within them, the harmful effects of their cults)...
[@ ^ 6.] ^^ Is there 'elo level' regarding 'digital minimalism' and 'extreme privacy' (a.k.a. michael bezzel? (?)) ==> Apparently can't touch that because moving to ramat aviv is on a 'higher note' than 'worrying about extreme privacy' because if I'm not 'careful' then the whole shebang of being near 'internet' & 'privacy' could be 'taken away' from me ... so it's secondary unfortunately (and things will inevitably 'spill' the painful ones which shouldn't ...)
[@ ^ 6.1.]
[@ ^ 7.] ^^ Just curious - is there 'elo level' with bridge? ==> Well yep if you sit 3h bridge marathon with Oren Lidor and/or Doron Yadlin -- you will either score less or score more or equal -- and that determines your elo level compared to them ... 
[@ ^ 7.1.] ^^ This elo level is rather 'sparse' compared to chess e.g. statistical-rather but in overall sense if you run 10-days marathon against one of them ... then their { (1) Memorisation of bidding language. (2) Knowledge to recognise of signals when playing hand. (3) A little bit of algorighmic thinking of how to play and what not to play depending on what partners played (but this algorithmic thinking is much less 'deep' than chess) (4) ? } ==> will to a large extent determine whether they win or a lose in points in that 10 days marathon. But then again, this is not a 'measure' of anything ... e.g. their algorithmic thinking might be more 'mediocre' than a chess player ... their 'language of bidding' knowledge -- might be due to them having inherited that from their rich parents from childhood ... just like french was a language of 'high circles' in some non-french societies ... but again the purpose of this is mostly about not the 'elo' but rather having some sort of alternate venue of connecting with people / making connections with people ... but then again ... this is not the sole way of making connections ... and it's possible that existence of interconnected internet has made this 'bridge' lucrativity even more obsolete ... as one could simply invest in making an arbitrage bot and blow all the bridge people out of the water ... I mean in a sense that 'bridge' was some sort of 'gamble-pointing of a finger' when you were out of options ... and so you saw e.g. some ad in tel-aviv university sports club and thought: ha! this must be it! ... but it is very possible that for example working with parts and interrogating them with protector questions ... in retrospect ... wouldn't bring you to any 'bridge' seeking altogether. E.g. in a sense of: nothing's broke -- don't apply any sort of 'band-aid' on top of it ... it's like more like carrying some notion of 'if it's all so seemingly 'too calm'' then 'add even more overwhelm on top of it' -- 'and then it all will become clear!' sort of mindset .. which might in retrospect not overwhelm -- the already overwhelmed & mega-traumatised system.
[@ ^ 7.1.1.] ^^ When nobody talks ... there's not to 'bring yourself to people' to cause additional overwhelm on the system, that might in fact, be traumatised and needed more of that ramat aviv immersion ...
[@ ^ 7.1.1.1.] ^^ Probably even 4.30 wouldn't exist and many things wouldn't exist should I have known about 'nonsense lana physicist' much earlier on.
[@ ^ 7.1.1.1.1.] ^^  William Kingdon Clifford: "'It is wrong, always, everywhere and for any one, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence.'"
[@ ^ 8.] ^^ Is there 'cryptocurrency elo rating'? (aka. 'elo rating pertaining to cryptocurrency')
[@ ^ 8.1.] ^^ Blockchain & Crypto Technology books are probably '>' (bigger) in that domain-or-realm, than 'airdrop farming' ... (considering that plain 'indie-crypto lifetime narrative' is 'overwhelm' ...) 
[@ ^ 8.1.1.] ^^ In a sense that 'dry studying' of that technology somehow helps more than just plain farming/sybilling (although counter-intuitive (wtf does studying even help?!?!? (?)))) ...
[@ ^ 8.2.] ^^ Reading a substantial chunk of crypto-technology-or-blockchain-technology [<script name='book'>makeQuizElem2('Ym9vaw==','&lt;pomflh&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] before doing any faucets and/or airdrops? (?) (in a sense of 'which is higher elo level?' - wise)) -- you have staking already ... so ... 
[@ ^ 8.2.1.] ^^ What I'm trying to get to - is to do only minimalist super-obvious airdrop farming ... and like 2-3 precalculated steps (didn't need to jerky-signup for neither ampleforth, nor optimism, nor stargaze, nor evmos, nor aptos, nor paraswap, nor cowswap, etc.) ... jerky-signups definitely f*cks me up. And a 'book' before faucets could get me into an appropriate mood before jumping onto twitter? (?)
[@ ^ 9.] [WOMEN_1] ^^ Is there such a thing as a 'dating elo rating' (as in r/datingoverfifty)? Or lack-of-dating-thereof elo-rating? In a sense that, m, it could be probably related to why ''indie-crypto lifetime narrative' elo rating' is an overwhelm, compared to 'cryptocurrency elo rating' ... ? (?) (?) (?)
[@ ^ 9.1.] ^^ Maybe it's just 'living around women' elo (without involving any sort of 'dating' or 'datingoverfifty' or 'lack-of-dating',, yet ...)
[@ ^ 9.2.] ^^ The horrid reality that ~ 30% of people don't know -- is that residental buildings (everywhere?) are dominated by women ... and by reading MRA materials you achieve two things: (1) To gather context and see also the ugly side of women unlike your reproductory organ wants to 'idealise',, and (2) Hopefully understanding of an importance of why tho f*** you should leave residential buildings from time to time (they are not really 'safety heaven') -- one of this techniques, by the way which you learned from Owen Cook about that dirty unstiffling sh*t that women do all the time. That context you got from mra/redpill. Was it helpful or harmful instead? ==> G-d knows. ... but in a sense ... it somewhat resembles the 'seeing through the matrix' analogy-or-metaphor (in a very dark and unhealthy sense, though). So jury is out on that one ... but anyway - the knocks are persistent, and are definitely an annoyance at times (bpd/did women? (?))
[@ ^ 9.2.1.] ^^ Point being: mra/redpill does help with some survival tricks where no one will explain. But only whisper. It got you f*cked, for sure, but then it also got -- internet is a double-edged sword ... point being is that ... sometimes in super-stuck states when I feel that I am what-ifs-cornered and crawling on ceilings for hours -- watching that context -- provides relief and nothing else is known to me which provides relief in those particular what-ifs-cornered-type-of-situations. Maybe I'll find it someday - but for now it's that.
[@ ^ 9.2.1.1.] ^^ To be able to find/spot/act-upon 'weaknesses' in seemningly flawless americanized female lawyers / female judges ... (for the aim of 'legal-self-defense') (is such thing even ever possible?) (?)
[@ ^ 9.2.1.1.1.] ^^ Get to books don't just stop at documentaries (that is a generic higher elo from experience in other parallel domains)
[@ ^ 10.] ^^ Is there ''indie-crypto lifetime narrative' elo rating' (aka. 'elo rating' pertaining to 'indie-crypto narrative') 
[@ ^ 10.1.] ^^ That is seemingly unfortunately is 'overwhelm' of some 'unknown kind' (when you had 8-9k$ - this was not an overwhelm) so unfortunately go back to 'cryptocurency elo rating' and dwell there? (?)

<div hidden>tag: ifs_elo_elaboration_1,,</div>
[#] Misc Notes - IFS ELO elaborations (if there's ever such thing like 'ifs-interrelated elo-rating')

[@ ^ 4.] [IFS_1] ^^ Is there 'maintaining the same ELO' with ifs? ==> Seems like not so it means that ifs is a 'bottomless pit' yet in some certain situational overwhelm situations it is very useful... and there are a lot of overwhelming situational situations in certain specific GPS locations ... ==> tbd1,,
[@ ^ 4.1.] ^^ Also: ifs is not a bottomless pit in a sense that if a specific individual is in some cult (or jumping between cults) ... then ifs provides an 'academically-refined' cult which is a 'less' 'bottomless pit' than some other 'cults' that exist out there ... due to 'academia-peer-review' property of it ...,, but still tbd1
[@ ^ 4.1.1.] ^^ So in a sense ifs is not a 'bottomless pit' but rather is a 'lesser' 'bottomless pit' which is good for segments of population who reside in a 'bottomless pit' (e.g. cults followers who do not realise and/or blackout within them, the harmful effects of their cults)...

[>] ^^ One point is that 'talking about ifs' would definitely be a 'low' 'elo rating' because it turns 'mind-os' into 'ban-os' (as in 'banned from all ifs therapists' because talked about ifs to everybody, and then need to pay SteveP $$$$$ dollors and in case of ifs -- probably a ban) ...
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ And here you lost me (but what's left now is either 'chess' to avoid talking or a large bonding leverage (which unfortunately after do kwon I don't have)  ... (and henceforth we try and maintain) ...
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ In case of 'chess' - ?

[>] The 'overdose-of-shame overdose' 'self-harm' aspect
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ For now it's 'symbolized' by shibashi? (?)

[>] The 'schnitzel' aspect ...
[@ ^ 1.] Whilst visualising -- it's difficult to be a 'vegeterian bjj fighter' even if I plan to come there once in 5-10 years ... just eat a tiny fokking piece of schnitzel.

[>] [OUTSIDE_1] [FREE_TO_YELL_ZONE_1] The 'free-to-yell' zone/place (after 6PM or sometimes even before) - aspect
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Even if I'm doing tai-chi at home -- supposedly want to get outside in the evening - and try to perform it outside for the second time ... because the demonic emotions sometimes are still stuck and want to be 'yelled out' when I can 'safely' 'yell them out' (there are not many such places in gush dan, unfortunately -- and are getting less and less so).

[>] [CHESS_1] The 'Chess' aspect ... ==> Q. Wtf is chess important not to omit when dealing with 'not giving up entirely on martial arts'?
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ With e.g. bjj -- you're still suspectible to 'cult mind control'.
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ Competition, and/or 'sensing boundaries' with other 'competitive men' almost throws 'dementia' 'out of the window' (but this doesn't come for 'free' -- it's with enormously demonic emotions though). 
[@ ^ 2.1.] ^^ But what the f*ck dementia has to do with 'martial arts entirely narrative' ==> 'Achievement' && 'Forgetfulness' is rather a dangerous combustion.

[>] Not getting 'provocated' by knocking neighbors at any cost. Imagination. Wildly. 

Additional factors:

[>] The 'this guy is too old and he's trying' shame ('haha!') factor ... ==> Probably for me the coercive abuse or whatever that is - just doesn't stop with age -- just shtaktel ya shmaktel. ==> So kind of redirect it into 'ahh, I want 150 million $ bitcoin (the form of money that is not dependent on some specific person giving it to me) -- not shameful at any age'

[#] Misc Notes - Shore Border, prison and freedom narrative 

[>] Basically, the idea of visiting ramat aviv every 72 hours, is because (1) If I delay it for 'too long' then traveling there - even after 48+ hours of staying there nearby (or near) (or adjacent to) the seashore -- I still won't be able to find a difference between prison and freedom (*1) ... and will fall asleep uncontrollably (*2) ... and then I will be forcefully taken! (which is unwanted? (?) (<-- haha! lol! ... --> see (*3),(*4) --> lol! lololololololololol!) 
[@ ^ 1.] (*1) ^^ (similar things happened where I couldn't, bluntly in-your-face watching the sea and standing literally near it at night, snap out of, the thought that 'prison is better than freedom' into 'freedom is better then prison') ==> ... so how come this then couldn't come to 'being unable to dissect even after just f*cking 48+ hours staying there' (if I delayed 'myself' in petah-tikva for 'too long'?)) ???
[@ ^ 2.] (*2) (like also happened in yaar bon (I just said f*ck it - I'm laying down wtf ja! ja! - aaand so I did ... and woke up at ~ 7 pm (luckily no one noticed a near-homeless person lying on the ground ...))
[@ ^ 3.] (*3) (and then though, it might require some bueracracy to get out they might 'test' me there for half a year ... one thing is when I myself get 'напасти' and going and trying to snap out ... the other thing entirely is when other people are directly involved and are 'supervising' my 'snapping out' process,) ... (tbd1,,)
[@ ^ 4.] (*4) also I just 'vaguely' remember that no matter what you think _now_ under mild tobacco influence & possibly some other lsd-like toxins that they 'secretly' 'shoved' there,, but after you resided in the same room with 4 foreign people the 'serial humiliation' dynamic (like in handesaim with 'roi') slowly started to 'sneak in' and you wanted out of there like 'off the hot stove' ... so again ... it might be possible that some lsd-like substances in Pall Mall Blue are doing that to me (this 'unable to discern between 'prison' and 'freedom' states) ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Need a functioning alarm clock in the f*cking house!

Additional notes:

[>] Q. Let's say that all day long (or for few days in a row) you were tirelessly ruminating on maintaing 'prison vs. freedom' elo rating ... and then by some miracle you ended up on some bycicle in, say, ramat-gan, and suddenly felt that you could 'discern' between 'prison and freedom' (as if it was a 'second nature to you') ... should you then turn back and go back home? ==>
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ A1: From one past date (a few months or a few years ago) when you were on the seashore -- looked at horison, and still could not discern between prison and freedom (as if it was your 'second nature') ... -- so theoretically it could be possible that one day, whilst looking at the seashore for 5 days in a row without leaving the seashore - you wouldn't be able even after 5 days to discern between 'prison' and 'freedom' ... so just as a matter of precaution ... maybe you'd want, if some battery is left - to travel all the way to the seashore as if it was some sort of 'hunger' that needed to be 'satisfied' ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ A1.1.: From some other past date (a few months or a few years ago) -- you were in some park and you laid on the ground, and you fell asleep (ah, just like that) and when you woke up -- it was nearly morning and you were lucky that nobody was still around (walking his/her dog or whatever etc etc etc.) ... so theoretically you could fall asleep and wake up either vandalised or in some police station.

Preamble: 
[>] Every f*cking single day they do this to me - this sc*m sh*t neighbors ...
[>] CPTSD Book: "If I am a bit repetitive at times about issues like 'shrinking the critic' and 'grieving the losses of childhood', it is my attempt to find different ways to emphasize the great importance of engaging these themes of recovery work over and over again. If you find yourself lost and not sure of how to get back onto the map, these themes will always be key portals for reentry."

Not resting day (cryptocurrency transactions are allowed):

[>] Trying to get back to making Gmx.io/gains.trade 'practice mode' fork via re-reading that book 3 times 
[^ @ 1.] ^^ Even without coding anything - this reduces 'steepness' ...

[>] Try to remember some random trauma I've had in the past ...

[>] Try to remember some random 'recklessness' I've had in the past ...

[>] r/MenGetRapedToo (& aflsd) and associated themes: rape in prison, perversiveness, ...

[>] Minecraft mod development and opengl books (re-reading to make it as chomprehensible as autohotkey) reduce 'steepness' - but are they a 'portal for re-entry'? (?) ... (*2)

[>] Eventually you know that after 72 hours in certain gps location - you will lose any 'key portals for reentry' whatsoever ... (just remindin')

Additional for Resting day (cryptocurrency transactions are not allowed):

What doesn't work, and why:

[>] Airdrop hunting 'bonding leverage accumulation' (but again via 5 minutes work tracking)

[>] 'Disruptive technologies' && 'people are slowly catching up' (this document is not just a raw text file on a filesystem (whatever that means ...) ...) .. it has some 'quiz' fields ... blank line js methods ... maybe more/other features could be added ... worst case - minecraft on Ctrl-Alt-M (in webgl) ... (?)
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ You can't 'find' this document when 'trying to code' for this document ... it's a chicken-and-egg question ...

References:
[>] (*1) ^^ [HUMAN_DEPTH_COMPLEXITY_1] Remember I've had this topic about 'games complexity' ... in 'losing this document' section? ==> Chess and 'shame-induced' 'self-harm' ... значит на улице все на тебя смотрят на твой холмик на лице и говорят сразу подсознательно 'чзх?!?!?' ('superficial dissing') и типа у тебя это 'отражается' как 'как ты смеешь показываться с таким уродством на улицу' и доходит до 'self-harm'a итп ..
[>>> 1.1.] А теперь ты говоришь что в конце теоретически доебавшись таким образом до тебя и захаяв и поставив тебя в угол ты им или ему можешь сказать: 'окей, ты говоришь что Я ничтожность, что Я такое х*йло -- давай тогда сыграем с тобой в такую-то такую-то игру ... и обыграть его 5 раз подряд с большой вероятностью' и это типа изменит его аттидьют из 'чзх?!?!?' в 'любопытство' ('ойй, а как это ты?!?') (и таким образом у меня спадет 'shame-induced' 'self-harm' по отношению к какому-то тому конкретному человеку ... (?)) ... и вероятно всего изменит внутреннее 'отражение' чужих взглядов (или только его конкретного взгляда? (?)) меньше в направлении 'self-harm'a ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ То есть если все смотрят с 'любопытством' это как-то 'неуютно' но не то что если все смотрят с 'чзх?!?!?!' взглядом (что доводило бы до 'селф-харм'а а не 'неуютности') ... и так не доходит до 'no bad parts frame rupture' (?)
[>>> 1.1.1.1.] [YOU_CHOOSE_WHICH_GAME_1] ^^ Прикол он однако так-же в том -- что это _ты_ выбираешь какую игру ему предложить чтобы с ним сыграть, и ты выбираешь именно ту игру в которой 'mastery' берет долгие-долгие годы (и тогда больше вероятности что ты рандомального чела на улице сможешь обыграть 5 раз подряд ...) ... чем если скажем ты возьмешь тетрис аттак, а у него природная реакция лучше и он тебя через 3 матча обосрет, и скажет -- а аа -- Я же говорил 'чзх!?!?!?' -- вот ... как собственно Я и говорил! Ты - х*йло! -- И у тебя опять до селф-харма и дойдет и опять из дома никуда высовываться не сможешь, неговоря уже об накапливающемся мусоре в квартире горами итп. 
[>>> 1.1.1.1.1.] ^^ Point being, that this might be exactly the dynamic that lies behind those 'Pete Walker's' 'CPTSD Flashbacks' that need you to 'search' for 'portals for reentry' in a sense that somehow, people through some noise dynamics can manipulate you into 'чзх?!?!?!' overwhelm (aka. ''wtf is this sh*t?' ddos overwhelm' / 'superficial dissing overwhelm') ==> which might require to 'reinforce' / 'reinstate' / 'reaffirm' your chess & complex games skills (again, gtfo of those gps locations as soon as possible! Govt doesn't care! --> you should care! ...)
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ Q. Again, why choosing and studying a 'weaker' game might be a problem? 
[@ ^ 2.1.] ^^ A1: Again, because, в третий раз подряд он тебя таки сможет обыграть - и скажет -- ну вот ... Я же говорил что ты л*х. А если выберешь с максимально возможной комплексностью игру то меньше таких шансов что ты ему проиграешь за 5 игр ... (tbd1,,)

[>] (*2) Minecraft helps with 'beyond self disciplining states' and/or 'situational overwhelms that 'sweep you off your feet' in a 'bad' sense of a word' ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Studying/reading minecraft related programming languages and opengl as a 'second language' can help help make the curve 'less steep' ... (implement every 'whim' ... (in absense of having nothing better to do))
[@ ^ 2.] [DO_NOT_ASK_1] One important caveat: it is possible that if you ask on reddit for 'seed string' for minecraft 1.19 forest-only world -- it will never be answered and will again destroy the property of minecraft being 'portal for reentry', hence:
[@ ^ 2.1.] ^^ Portal for reentry property of minecraft is only preserved when you don't escalate it to 'online q&a' but rather slowly systematically studying everything (java, opengl, step-through-debugging-and-commenting) that is related to minecraft ... for the said 'situational overwhelms' mentioned above ...
[@ ^ 3.] Q. Why shouldn't I ask about minecraft coding online?
[@ ^ 3.1.] ^^ A1.1: It is not 'portal for reentry' then ... but rather 'depending on some third person' to 'reentry' ...

First off, wtf do I even need this document for?
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ You need 'bonding leverage' for 'lipton tea' and if you have a decent 'bonding leverage', then this automatically assumes the existence of this document.

How Can I lose access to this document?
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ By losing 'internet & privacy' ...
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ Eyesight loss, loss of hand(s), huge physical crippling that makes impossible to work with a computer.

Section: Stages of 'losing this document' (both within this document and beyond it)

[>] Q. How can 'beyond it' happen? 
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Some sort of medical emergency that requires urgent medical attention (e.g. a fallen bleeding tooth.)

Stages of loss (in brief) (situational)
[@ ^ 1.] Memory loss (of existence this document altogether)
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^ No bitcoin no more ==> Then it just becomes some 'another' document in the filesystem ...

[@ ^ 2.] 'Ideological loss' (aka. persistent 'wtf's' or some other)
[@ ^ 2.1.] ^^ Most likely due to some sort of 'r/mengetrapedtoo' surrounding dynamic (wtf were there some distinct knocks once in 5-10 minutes, that corresponded to distressing thoughts of mine? (?)) ==> They know something that I don't hence 'r/mengetrapedtoo' dynamic of sorts.

[@ ^ 3.] 'Maintaining existing elo rating' in some area hyper-focus ability?
[@ ^ 3.1.] ^^ Most likely it is the lesser loss of them all, because there are always boundaries between men, as 3mp-apr && mp-3mp-apr has shown.
[@ ^ 3.1.1.] ^^ For now the most favorite is: { 'elo rating' && 'distress books' }

[@ ^ 4.] ^^ 'Track of time' loss ==> When you forget to discern between 'before 6PM' and 'after 6PM' activities ...

[@ ^ 4.] ^^ Actual airdrop farming loss ==> This is yes considered a loss, in a sense that, those are 'playing lottery' mostly
[@ ^ 4.1.] ^^ You might just have enough from mining to 'fill up to 100$ in bitcoin for the next 20 years' (although I need to find a way somehow to be persistent in regard to 'gaming pc' so I could at least have a mining possibility)
[@ ^ 4.1.1.] ^^ So hencefor it's a loss, as in I don't know how to really petition for gaming pc ==> So it's an exponential loss 'rabbit hole'.

[@ ^ 5.] ^^ Lifetime crypto narrative can help with 'silkom' in a sense that 'silkom' coercion might disconnect me from this document. ==> So I'm putting this here, because, it definitely doesn't belong to 'paper clog resolving' yet it came up to mind when I was 'trembling' for 'stages of loss' of this document ... (so initially I've written it into 'wtf paper' section ... but then it clearly didn't fit there ... so I'm putting it here instead ... (as a 'stage of loss'? hmmm ...)) ... 

[@ ^ 6.] ^ 'Varlakova excercise' loss ==> e.g. when it feels that the right thing to do right now is to 'focus on varlakova excercise'
[@ ^ 6.1.] ^^ Why is it a more 'loss' then 'elo rating' loss? ==> Again, not taking 'boundaries between men' into account (so hence it 'feels' like a more of a 'loss' than 'elo-rating' loss ) ...

[@ ^ 7.] ^ 'Crawling towards ifs therapist' mode ...
[@ ^ 7.1.] [PROBABLY_ABOVE_PAPER_CLOG_RESOLVING_1] ^^ This is probably above 'paper clog resolving' because there is such section is yes within this document ...
[@ ^ 7.2.] [PROBABLY_NEED_MINECRAFT_FOR_CHAT_POST_AGITATION_1] ^^ Just noting though ==> You might also probably need 'minecraft' (or 'minecraft coding' (or very least 'minecraft book' 'checking-up on' aka 'distress reading'), on top of 'longhand paper' (with a clog or without) to avoid the, umm, the 'sporaidic tongue slips into ifs zoom chats and discords' ...
[@ ^ 7.2.1.] ^^ The name for tongue slips was 'chat post agitation' (without a planned delay of one day before concieving and posting (!!))
[@ ^ 7.3.] ^^ r/MenGetRapedToo dynamic might be at large at play here ... (there was also thoughts about { 'evidence flipping' 'social proof' } -- but again ... this might be a 'subset' of some general ongoing r/MenGetRapedToo dynamic (whose nuances I don't fully understand ... (due to not being their 'homie')) ...

[@ ^ 6.] ^ Paper clog resolving ==> Probably even more loss than 'varlakova' because the 'methodology of it' is beyond the scope of this document ... (aka if I'm focusing extensively on 'paper clog' for, say 48-72 hours then I'm clearly am not focusing on this document ...

Stages of loss (non-situational (aka not due some 'situational distress' that you have to 'tremble for', to 'find')) (e.g. doesn't change from 6-8-10 AM to 6-8-10 PM):

[@ ^ 1.] Neglecting minecraft coding for many many days ...
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ My estimation that minecraft is ~ 2% complete (no android version, no encrypted signs, no Ctrl-M webgl, textures are sh*tty, no 'portals',  ... (tbd1,,))
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ Testnets are not 'consistent' so it's 100$ in BTC and also is yes minecraft (I wish I had 100k$ in btc, though).

[@ ^ 2.] Losing this document by failing to negotiate properly with parents and family ...

[@ ^ 3.] Existence & availability of gains.trade 'practice mode' -- helps with 'гулкая голова' ... (and 'гулкая голова' can make me go ballistic and temporarily (situationally) lose access to this document ...)
[@ 

[@ ^ 2.] Not visiting shore border every 72 hours could cause me lose this document? (?)
[@ ^ 2.1.] ^^ Getting out in sloppy/negligient clothing and grooming is a sort of a 'noncomformism' that is 'designed' to 'plow through' 'toxic shame' (see separate topic on that) and henceforth, like any noncomformism will be pecked at by angry cops so grounding in 'police apprehension protocol' books could be important for 'not losing this document'? (maybe I'm getting too carried away here ... (?))

[@ ^ 5.] [DISRUPT_1] ^^ 'This document is a semi-public website with a legal disclamer, heh? It helps you sometimes when traveling outside, heh? It's a disruptive technology, heh? And people are slowly catching up, heh? So it might be that slowly slowly, in the future, this website's helpfulness effect might be severely diminished, heh? (?) 
[@ ^ 5.1.] ^^ I'm just speculating here, you know ...
[@ ^ 5.1.1.] ^^ In a sense that when everyone and his mother has a semi-public website then traveling outside factor of such website would be nonexistent, heh? Like e.g. when only you have a fridge and everyone else has to hop to a store to buy ice, you feel relative comfort.
[@ ^ 5.1.1.1.] ^^ So it might be not exactly how I lose this document, like in a few years ... but might theoretically happen so that even this document will get lost in the pile of 'filesystem' and I 'just won't find ... just won't find ...'

Section: Q. What to do when glided off this document, to, say, onto 'paper clog' resolving and can't touch this document for a long time still nevertheless still?

[>] ^^ A1: Tooth doctor calmed 'a little' the 'beyond 'too much spirituality'' status of my falling tooth. He, aka a certified MD doctor, has sad that by him - it is acceptable that a tooth will fall by itself, and that he doesn't see some sort of horrific medical emergency beside giving me an antibiotic, should there be an inflammation. Aka it's not 'negligience' of immense degree (if I only had a ferrari).

[>] ^^ 'Distress books' && 'ELO rating' is still insofar your best chance to save most possible organs in the body (because it ...)
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ That's so far an opinion (though maybe possible that I will be able to visit another tooth doctor in the future) ...
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ The rationale being: 
[@ ^ 2.1.] ^^ I'm able to 'open up' about much more things with myself, due to 'immersive places' promixity ... 
[@ ^ 2.2.] ^^ Less 'beyond self-disciplining' periods ... (that possibly happen due to some sort of ongoing 'r/mengetrapedtoo' resembling dynamic in petah tikva, that 
is not even my business and never was) ...
[@ ^ 2.3.] ^^ Urgency flipping - again possibly happens due to some sort of 'r/mengetrapedtoo' resembling dynamic in 'petah tikva' ...
[@ ^ 2.4.] ^^ Much, much better chance to preserve own 'self-leadership' whilst being 'bankrupt' (because really when no-bad-parts-frame-rupture ensues and there's no money -- that's not exactly going to be 'ifs therapist' ) ...
[@ ^ 2.4.1.] ^^ e.g. the 'ifs' is not a 'cover-all-umbrella' and it has an 'abyss' within it. Without addressing that ifs-and-bankrupcy--abyss it's much more difficult to address 'rotting teeth' ...

[>] ^^ I'm not even sure that I can go to bjj with a 'dental implant' (tbd1,,)

Misc Notes (tosort):

[>] [MEN_GET_RAPED_TOO_1] 'r/MenGetRapedToo' is a very dim light in eckhart tolle gloom ...

[>] So let's say we've focused on 'Distress Books' till 6PM -- and now 6 PM Came ... (tbd1,,)

[>] [GAMES_HUMAN_COMPLEXITY_1] Chess and 'shame-induced' 'self-harm' ... значит на улице все на тебя смотрят на твой холмик на лице и говорят сразу подсознательно 'чзх?!?!?' и типа у тебя это 'отражается' как 'как ты смеешь показываться с таким уродством на улицу' и доходит до 'self-harm'a итп ..
[>>> 1.1.] А теперь ты говоришь что в конце теоретически доебавшись таким образом до тебя и захаяв и поставив тебя в угол ты им или ему можешь сказать: 'окей, ты говоришь что Я ничтожность, что Я такое х*йло -- давай тогда сыграем с тобой в такую-то такую-то игру ... и обыграть его 5 раз подряд с большой вероятностью' и это типа изменит его аттидьют из 'чзх?!?!?' в 'любопытство' ('ойй, а как это ты?!?') (и таким образом у меня спадет 'shame-induced' 'self-harm' по отношению к какому-то тому конкретному человеку ... (?)) ... и вероятно всего изменит внутреннее 'отражение' чужих взглядов (или только его конкретного взгляда? (?)) меньше в направлении 'self-harm'a ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ То есть если все смотрят с 'любопытством' это как-то 'неуютно' но не то что если все смотрят с 'чзх?!?!?!' взглядом (что доводило бы до 'селф-харм'а а не 'неуютности') ... и так не доходит до 'no bad parts frame rupture' (?)
[>>> 1.2.] [YOU_CHOOSE_WHICH_GAME_1] ^^ Прикол он однако так-же в том -- что это _ты_ выбираешь какую игру ему предложить чтобы с ним сыграть, и ты выбираешь именно ту игру в которой 'mastery' берет долгие-долгие годы (и тогда больше вероятности что ты рандомального чела на улице сможешь обыграть 5 раз подряд ...) ... чем если скажем ты возьмешь тетрис аттак, а у него природная реакция лучше и он тебя через 3 матча обосрет, и скажет -- а аа -- Я же говорил 'чзх!?!?!?' -- вот ... как собственно Я и говорил! Ты - х*йло! -- И у тебя опять до селф-харма и дойдет и опять из дома никуда высовываться не сможешь, неговоря уже об накапливающемся мусоре в квартире горами итп. 
[>>> 1.3.] ^^ So this is sort of a 'lurking' dynamic that most likely will become more apparent in the future as I age ... (as a foreign immigrant in some foreign gps location) ...
[>>> 1.4.] ^^ You could also 'mix' it with 'grimacing shibashi' to even more reduce 'shame-induced' 'self-harm' effect ... (?) (or so it feels (a gut feeling)) (?)
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ Q. Again, why choosing and studying a 'weaker' game might be a problem? 
[@ ^ 2.1.] ^^ A1: Again, because, в третий раз подряд он тебя таки сможет обыграть - и скажет -- ну вот ... Я же говорил что ты л*х. А если выберешь с максимально возможной комплексностью игру то меньше таких шансов что ты ему проиграешь за 5 игр ... (tbd1,,)

[>] [PAPER_CLOG_AND_LOSING_THIS_DOCUMENT_1] Finding way back to this document through longhand paper: *MUST DISCARD THAT PAPER* that's a big key. If you use paper to find this document -- with accumulating clog -- you'll look - and never find ... never find ... never find ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Paper is better than computer in times of extreme head nausea. Because you don't trust yourself to get to computer because you'll watch endlessly that twitter feed.
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ So I suppose one activity - is to sift repeatedly through accumulated piles of paper for 1000th time, and discard, if possible! (that's a one missing key)

[>] [LOSING_CONSCIOUSNESS_1] Trying to 'make order' in 'paper clog' activities ==> What eventually ends up happening, that I get 'lost' again (because, ha! - { paper clog } is not { 'this document' } and doesn't have neither '100$ in bitcoin' nor 'minecraft coding' attached to it) (very quick, within few hours or a day or two (again, most likely due to that r/mengetrapedtoo dynamic, that is enshrined here somehow or something ...)) -- so then the most 'rational' solution would be is to 'train through injuries' (aka. like Quinton Jackson or somebody else that I don't want to mention here ...) aka 'neglect & ignore medical emergencies' just for sakes to 'not get lost again' (until I've lost conscious aka 'ability to focus' on anything at all ... (e.g. unconsciously hospitalized without being able to control it, at all)) ...

[>] ^^ Tremble for 'paper clog' (or 'this document') ...
[@ ^ 1.] Wtf tremble for 'paper clog'? ==> Sometimes I can't access to the pc b/c I know I'll watch twitter for hours and nothing will be done and I'm lost.
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ 'Trauma Grounding' via paper is impossible if a clog gets accumulated ... ==> This is definitely an incoherence for many reasons ...
[@ ^ 1.1.1.] ^^ One reason for resolving paper clog is - because I myself wrote 'todisp_1' on each page specifically ... a neglect could grow into, m, 'shoving things under the rug' and '5000 depot shots won't help' ... so it's either 'this document' or 'paper clog' ...
[@ ^ 2.] Wtf tremble for this document? ==> See notes above 'how can I lose access to this document?'
[@ ^ 3.] Taking a wild assumption here ==> Drop them in the evening into in-house garbage can ...

[>] [TAI_CHI_IMAGES_1] ^^ Also in the evening try to organise shibashi and then tai-chi images with red arrows.

[>] Mining card repair && buying rack still is relevant - it earns me 48$/year and can make this document hold, should I transfer all my earnings of rvn/ubiq into bitcoin (no need for leverage trading and/or evmos staking whatsoever (if I manage to keep programming the minecraft around this document))
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Most likely github will stay free ... (or it's clones) ...

[#] Misc Notes - Losing this document by failing to negotiate properly with parents and family ...

Preamble:

[>] [GAINS_TRADE_1] So far, I can't 100% rely on 'gains.trade' (for negotiation 'wtf I have this trump card' leverage) practice mode because they can shut it off at any time. So it's important to do some steps to replicate gains.trade practice mode ('at least I tried ...') ...

[>] [BONDING_LEVERAGE_FOR_NEGOTIATION_1] So far, I can't rely on 8-9k$ for negotiation 'wtf I have this trump card' leverage - because those are non-methodological and not systematic.

Preamble 2 - Preceeding Context Try 1:
[>] Ну давай скажем что типа благодаря '~ 100$ in bitcoin' и также gains.trade' practice-mode-'у ... типа и также скажем пониманию что у аурелия брауэрс это типа 'смотрение слишком долго в 'бездну'' которая может привести к 'unexpected bad suprise' of such a degree that it would be beneficial to just live and die natural death somewhere in the future would be 'less catastrophic' than such 'unexpected bad suprise' ... we want to navigate ourselves back to 'near-lamed' and/or find some other 'semi-shady-acceptable' solution to the impending clash with 'conservator'/'опекун'/'апотроптос' ...

[>] Далее Я хочу квеллить/'to quell' his doubts that I'm 'lazy' (his 'fingerprint'/'cornerstone' 'gaslight') and not doing anything, via, sending him relevant book summaries (that I'm reading and are relevant to programming) ... 
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ But then again, this spirals me into infinite dilemmas about what am I to send him (thanks, knockorz, who probably got infinite amount of monero, so that they could 'back up' their 'stifledness' checks every 5 minutes (in a 'who's the most unstiffled person in the building' competition dynamic)) and eventually effectively makes me _unable_ to send him sh*t which in turn 'strengthengs' his 'claim' that I'm a 'lazy'/'worthless' bum (his 'fingerprint'/'cornerstone' gaslight) ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ So what am I to do what am I to do what am I to do?!?!?

Overview (of line of defense):

[>] His gaslighting 'накаленный разговор' (cannot find, will have to 'improvise', by 'making it all about high-tech job'):
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Want to find from that phone call how did I call it 'заостренная зона?' ?

[>] Safety nets for his gaslights & backing up on promises (again, do not debate gaslighting with him, but to be able to guide myself from post-conversational glooms & twilights):
[@ ^ 1.] [SAFETY_NET] Posting him books summaries (of difference between '12 year-old smart contract developer' and '30 years old smart contract developer')

Tasks: (they are here):

[>] HDD Password on desktop pc - not done.

[>] ^^ So far, I can rely probably the best, on coding my own semi-useful projects (and minecraft) that might be semi-useful to me in the future (for myself) as my best chance of 'negotiation leverage' ...
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ How is that even a 'negotiation leverage'? (?)
[@ ^ 1.1.] ^^ A1: For example, this document is a semi-public website with a legal disclamer, heh? It helps you sometimes when traveling outside, heh? It's a disruptive technology, heh? And people are slowly catching up, heh? So it might be that slowly slowly, in the future, this website's helpfulness effect might be severely diminished, heh? (?)

[#] Ifs Therapists Landscape Ban Discernance ('Ifs therapists incoherence') and what we are doing next

[>] ^^ Preamble: If you can't 'discern' between prison and freedom (for the sake of self-reprimanding via 'you'll lose 100$ in bicoin then you'll lose access to this document') then so far you can at least discern the 'ifs therapists landscape ban' vs. 'sleep doctor final verdict' 'in-between-chairs' situation as an 'undesireable' situation ... (even though 'rape in prison is yes 'enjoyable'' -- the {'ifs therapists landscape ban' vs. 'sleep doctor final verdict' in-between-chairs } is at least for now, still yet, just yet, is still yet - undesireable (in a sense of 'not enjoyable')
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ And the 'bigger' problem with it ... is that if I felt the difference between 'prison' and 'freedom' -- I could 'discipline' myself e.g. via 'if you leverage trade -- you'll go to prison!' but @#$% I can't even self-discipline myself here for that! (!!!) Damn! Damn! Damn! Damn! Damn!
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ So we're left with, like, m, 'tremble for that incoherence' (and hope and pray that we don't start liking the 'being between chairs' between { banned from all ifs therapist and 'sleep doctor final verdict' isn't 'in' yet } too ... just as we love already the 'rape in prison' thing ... ) (?)

[>] [2022.11.11 23:59] ^^ Update: apparently even the, m, hyper-focus on 'ifs therapists landscape ban' incoherence - кануло в канун (или в 'pink' х/з) --> I just stopped feeling even that 'boundary' !!! (!!!)
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Do not panic, probably it's because it doesn't address 'tai-chi'? ==> So then back to 'maintaining elo rating' of 'discernance' between 'prison' and 'freedom' ... (?)
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ Or back to 'ifs therapists' 'crawling mode' because I don't feel any boundary now whatsoever!!
[>>> 1.1.1.1.] ^^ Bye bye, 'books fasting' ... (?)

[>] [DRAFT_1] ^^ So then what are we doing next, according to that discernance?

[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Though again it has that 'looking too long into abyss' element so still you want to travel to n.q. from time to time to obtain that 'lesser-looking-into-abyss' 'prison-vs-freedom' discernance ...

Things to do:

[>] 'Books fasting' under 'leverage-trading-cheerleading' knockors ... 
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Since we're talking here about issues 'like' 'death' and 'suicide' -- maybe even listening to alex ham is a burnout (doesn't fit 'death' narrative) ... 
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ There were people not long ago who lived on books only. Didn't know about guitars. My head is over-buzzing from whole-day-twitter viewing. 
[>>> 1.1.1.1.] ^^ So refer back to 'distress_books_1' section even after 6PM.

[>] 'Distress coding' (besides 'distress book') to 'keep'/'hold onto' this document (upto minecraft-in-webgl-on-ctrl-m) because 'death' is a 'tearing thing' surely it will tear this document apart - one way or another (either through clicking 'trade' button or some other 'unexpected bad surprise' scenario) ... ==> There's also 'distress coding to save this document' section ...

[>] 'r/MenGetRapedToo' is also very much related to 'sleep doctor final verdict' incoherence but I guess I have some 'exposure' to it through 'distress books' (in which 'mra/women/mengetraped' books also are included (see that 'distress_books_1' section (but last time I checked -- they are yes included there ...) ...) ...

[>] Coding father excercise - потому что ты понимаешь что они 'сильнее' потому что у них 'у миши', 'у папы' ... жизнь 'удалась' и по этой причине они 'сильнее' и писать программки чтобы сжалились над тобой/надо мной что мол когда разговор зайдет 'в тупик' опять -- каким то макаром выражать это через 'программу' но до 'силком' не довести (в худшем случае 'пересказывать' книгу своими словами) ...

Old-torevise-or-remove:
[>] Code minecraft in ecma script on Ctrl-M, and all preludes before that minecraft (After 6 PM).
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ How's that even related to that discernance? (?) ==> Well call that a 'hunch' since that one is 'looking too long into the abyss' and I can't tell you straight from abyss all the answers to all the 'why's' ... but then again if something better than this comes along then we'll probably know and prioritise ... (tbd1,,)
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ So for now we're doing what? The 'search in all db's' script? (tbd1,,)
[>>> 1.1.1.1.] ^^ The section of 'minecraft_homebrew_precursors_1_tag_1' was very difficult to find, so I had to resubmit trades at gains.io,, and most likely even with having one document -- they will be spread all over the document and there will be few inconsistencies on what's the next micro-step or next micro-pilot,, so worst case - you'll do two micro-pilots at once or one micro-pilot twice ... no biggie ... (it's _our_ homebrew ... ) ...

[#] Misc Notes - WTF Paper is needed ? 

[>] Again, be wary of 'r/mengetrapedtoo' dynamic (because all those sc*m sh*t 'wtf' questions do not just pop-up for 'no reason' -- a correlation has been 'spotted' ...)

[>] In some so-called 'ultra-dense population' gps locations, I am just unable to 'creatively vent' issues with paper (e.g. 'throwing traumas into the river') (and 'aurelia browers' didn't come .. didn't come ...) ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ With that said, tbd1,,


[>] Wtf Paper? Wtf?
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ It would cause immense calmness during 'catastrophes' (which inevitably of course this planet earth is not devoid of) or during 'devastating losses' or during 'inner-critic-overwhelm' states ... if I could just put all my thoughts on paper, as a 'calming'/'spindown' technique. And henceforth the paper serves as 'grounding' 'entry portal' to try and aspire to, if I lost this very document.
[@ ^ 2.] 'Я сейчас психану' - like states ...
[@ ^ 3.] ^^ 'Nowhere to 'shove' myself' - like -- states ...
[@ ^ 3.1.] ^^ Those sometimes happen few days after sporaidically 'stumbling upon' the even the 'smell' of michael's immigrational adaptation and success ...
[@ ^ 4.] ^^ If I'm still in some sort of undecided borderline medical emergency (that I can't focus on this document properly (thoughts take me 'away' (e.g. another tooth loss))) ==> and henceforth I need to clean up the clog for exactly those types of scenarios., 
[@ ^ 5.] ^^ In some 'ultra-dense population homes' there are _hours_ without 'definite descisions' where some descision jumps in but then it's clearly not what need be done (aka. 'подвешенность state') and ability to be able to freely write or even draw on paper without worries (ok, there are masturbations, I know, ...) during those states -- is paramount (?)

experience of how a well timed well chosen and evocative metaphor can help unlock the dispute resolution process ... this metaphor of parts is not new Plato
had the notion that we have parts to the two horses the positive and the negative energies and the charioteer the tries to manage them Freud of course thought we
had parts the ideo and super-ego the idea that we have parts is one that scholars in our field have been writing about of late billiary Erica Fox Garry Friedman all of these books take as their premise that we are engaged in an internal negotiation all the time all of us and the people that we work with as well ... this article from several years ago 1998 by Max bazerman and colleagues is a wonderful introduction to this concept in this article the authors talk about us having basically two cells the want self which is impulsive and the should self which is rational in this a more recent article by Bob Borden and colleagues talking about how the internal negotiation over our identity and role plays an important function in our negotiations and then in the materials the for this talk you may have seen a link for this article and also for this shorter article and when you get the slides if you want to access these articles you'll have links to them finally in terms of this being a a model that is out there in the world if you have not seen the Academy award-winning movie inside out I encourage you to see it it depicts each of the people in the

[#] Project - invest 0.0001$ everywhere (into every blockchain and protocol out there) (just for the sake of 'fomo' and 'compound hack' potential drop)

[>] ^^ From here projects will go into 'archive.html' page ...
[>] ^^ The good news is 'no rush' and 'no pressure' ... and 'no information overload overwhelm' and no 'gaming faucets & vs. regular faucets' headf*ckery ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Also - it helps with FOMO of ''I'm doing cosmos stakers airdrops only' and not expanding onto other opportunities, wtf?!?!??'

[>] Previously, 'information overload overwhelm' section ... (either there or copy to here) ... this seems a logical step, no?
[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Also, process mycomments's twitter bookmarks no?

Information overload overwhelm:
[>] Deepwaters разослал токены DELVE за testnet , Метамаск в сети Polygon (капнуло 50 штук). Стартовал testnet 2.0


So, onto the mission:
[>] AnimeSwap (Aptos Wallet's Apps tab) ==> I swapped there 1 time before their airdrop ... dunno if I want to invest there anything further into lp and such ...

[>] [BT1]:```No new task guys? 😁 ==> 
What do u mean? Did u interact with Zksync mainnet? Arb mainnet? Optimism?
I would do them daily, plenty of tokenless protocols there
Besides there is a shit ton of other stuff like all the lens products, lenster/lenstube/phaver to interact with daily
Zerion/slingshot/bungee/orbiter/rabbithole/quest3/layer3 etc a lot of protocols just to name a few
I could write a list that you couldnt finish in a week 🙂 so much to do

[>>> 1.1.] See in offline doc where it comes from (for now).
